,Lastacaft Eye Allergy Itch Relief Drops,"When your eyes become itchy from allergies, look to LASTACAFT Once Daily Eye Allergy Itch Relief Antihistamine Eye Drops for fast-acting, long-lasting relief. Just a single drop of LASTACAFT in each eye once per day relieves itchy eyes due to allergies in as little as 3 minutes and lasts all day long (through 16 hours). So how does LASTACAFT work? When allergens in the air come into contact with your eyes, histamine is released which is the body's natural defense mechanism that causes an allergic response which can make your eyes itch. Only LASTACAFTs patented, prescription-strength formula contains the active ingredient Alcaftadine 0.25%, an ophthalmic antihistamine that relieves eye itching from allergies also known as allergic conjunctivitis. Just one drop of LASTACAFT relieves itchy allergy eyes by 1) blocking histamine H1 receptors and 2) preventing further release of more histamine in the eye. LASTACAFT works in minutes against both seasonal and year-round allergens which include pollen, grass, ragweed, animal hair, and pet dander so that you're covered indoors and outdoors throughout the day. Unlike oral antihistamine allergy medications, LASTACAFT is applied directly to the eye, relieving eye itchiness in just 3 minutes. And LASTACAFTs one-of-a-kind formula is available over-the-counter no prescription required. LASTACAFT is tough on allergies, while being easy on the eyes. It can be used in adults and can be given to children as young as 2 years of age. LASTACAFT Once Daily Relief Antihistamine Eye Drops also provide great value. Each bottle contains a 60-day supply, which is twice the amount compared to the leading Once Daily Eye Allergy Itch Relief brand.  So, when it comes to relieving itchy allergy eyes, no matter the season, ITS LASTACAFT SEASON.

1-Alkalol Nasal Wash Cup
Use Alkalol as a nasal wash and mucus solvent to help clear blocked nasal passages and provide drug-free relief from nasal congestion and irritation caused by sinusitis, allergies, head colds, and post-nasal drip.
In 1896, pharmacist James P. Whitters set out to formulate a soothing nasal wash designed to deliver benefits beyond what standard saline solutions could provide without including the high levels of alcohol found in other products of the time.
The result was Alkalol, a refreshingly strong saline wash that contains a select blend of natural extracts and aromatic oils to help dissolve mucus, clean and moisturize the nasal passages, and provide invigorating relief from the symptoms of allergies and colds.
Alkalol soon became available throughout the United States and abroad, quickly gaining popularity with people searching for a more natural way to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergies, colds, and chronic congestion.
Four generations of the Whitters family have now been involved with the formulation and distribution of Alkalol, and the product you hold in your hand is essentially the same as the one developed in a small New England pharmacy over a century ago.
We hope you enjoy my grandfather's unique product.
- James P. Whitters, III
Alkalol is intended for use at variable strengths depending on personal preference and thickness of mucus. We recommend starting with a mild dose and adjusting according to preference.
Mild:
Add one teaspoon of Alkalol to the Alkalol Nasal Wash Cup, filling it approximately 20%, and the balance with saline or warm water.
Medium:
Add two teaspoons of Alkalol to the Alkalol Nasal Wash Cup, filling it approximately 40%, and the balance with saline or warm water.
Strong:
Add three teaspoons of Alkalol to the Alkalol Nasal Wash Cup, filling it approximately 60%, and the balance with saline or warm water.
Extra-Strong:
Add four teaspoons of Alkalol to the Alkalol Nasal Wash Cup filling it approximately 80%, and the balance with saline or warm water.
Alkalol is formulated to be refreshingly strong. Upon initial use, you may experience an invigorating sensation lasting a few seconds. This sensation is part of the process that allows Alkalol to work.

Stand in front of a sink, bend forward to comfort level and tilt your head down. Keep your mouth open and, without holding your breath, place the tip snugly in the nostril and squeeze the actuator until the solution starts draining from the opposite nasal passage or from your mouth. Allow the flow to continue for 2 to 3 seconds. Do not swallow the solution. Blow your nose gently, without pinching your nose completely, to avoid applying pressure on your eardrums. If tolerable, sniff in any residual solution remaining in the nasal passage once or twice prior to blowing your nose. This may clean out the posterior nasopharyngeal area, which is the area at the back of your nasal passage. At times, some solution may reach the back of your throat. If so, please spit it out. To help improve drainage of any residual solution, blow your nose gently while tilting your head to the side. Now repeat these steps on your other nasal passage.

For Adults and Children
Directions For NasaMist Saline Spray :
This drug-free, non-burning saline spray helps alleviate nasal allergies, dryness, post-nasal drip and congestion from the common cold or flu. Hypertonic delivers over twice the concentration of saline as Isotonic. Pediatric provides a specially designed box for babies and children and the tip is same as our standard blue box tip. Please contact your physician before using on babies under 6 months.
Step 1
: Insert tip of actuator into nostril and press gently until adequate volume has been sprayed and the nasal passages are moist.
Step 2
: Repeat for the other nostril. For babies and children, do not insert nozzle beyond the flange. Use as often as needed to moisturize.
Advantages of Hypertonic Solution
Extra Strength
*
Research shows that a Hypertonic (2.7%) or more concentrated solution may help reduce congestion better than an Isotonic (0.9%) solution. This is because a more concentrated salt solution will draw more water out of the congested tissue, reduce swelling and open up the nasal passages and sinus openings to allow for better drainage. It is possible that you may experience temporary burning or stinging with the Hypertonic solution. If this persists, please use our Isotonic spray.

DO NOT USE TAP WATER UNLESS STERILIZED BY BOILING
For your safety, do not use tap or faucet water for dissolving the mixture unless it has been previously boiled for five minutes or more as boiling sterilizes the water.

packets only. Our packets contain a mixture of USP grade sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. These ingredients are of the purest quality available to make the dry powder mixture. Rinsing your nasal passages with only plain water without our mixture will result in a severe burning sensation as the plain water is not physiologic for your nasal lining, even if it is appropriate for drinking. Additionally, for your safety, do not use tap or faucet water for dissolving the mixture unless it has been previously boiled for five minutes or more as boiling sterilizes the water. Other choices are distilled, micro-filtered (through 0.2 micron), commercially bottled or, as mentioned earlier, previously boiled water at lukewarm or body temperature. You can store boiled water in a clean container for seven days or more if refrigerated. Do not use non-chlorinated or non-ultra (0.2 micron) filtered well water unless it is boiled and then cooled to lukewarm or body temperature. Do not rinse if your nasal passages are completely blocked or if you have an ear infection or blocked ears. If you have had recent ear or sinus surgery, contact your physician prior to irrigation. If you experience any pressure in the ears or burning in the nasal passages, stop irrigation and get further directions from your physician. Keep out of reach of children. Read and retain this enclosed brochure for instructions and other important information.
Always Use Distilled or Micro-Filtered (through 0.2 micron) or Commercially Bottled or Previously Boiled & Cooled Down Water at Lukewarm or Body Temperature. Please do not use tap or faucet water when using NeilMed's nasal wash devices unless it has been previously boiled and cooled down.

We recommend that you use the rinse ONE HOUR PRIOR to bedtime in order to avoid any residual solution dripping down the throat.
We strongly advise against the use of our kit on children or adults who have physical limitations or mental disabilities due to developmental or acquired disorders. Adults should read the directions first before using it on their children. Keep out of reach of children. Do not swallow the solution; however, if you do so accidentally, there is no harm as the amount of sodium ingested in one swallow is insignificant.
Patients who are unable to stand up or bend near the sink SHOULD NOT use this product. We advise you NOT to use this kit on patients who are bed bound or severely debilitated.
Tips To Avoid Ear Discomfort While Rinsing
If you have had ear surgery, please contact your physician prior to irrigation.
Do not use if you have an ear infection or blocked ears.
Rinse with lukewarm distilled, filtered or previously boiled water.
Keep your mouth open.
Do not hold your breath while rinsing.
While rinsing, make sure to tilt your head as shown in the photo below.
Gently squeeze the bottle while rinsing; do not squeeze the bottle very forcefully.
Stop the rinse if you feel a sensation of fluid near your ears.
Most importantly, always blow your nose very gently.
To Avoid Unexpected Drainage After Rinsing:
In rare situations, especially if you have had sinus surgery, the saline solution can pool in the sinus cavities and nasal passages and then drip from your nostrils hours after rinsing. To avoid this harmless but annoying inconvenience, take one extra step after rinsing: lean forward, tilt your head sideways and gently blow your nose. Then, tilt your head to the other side and blow again. You may need to repeat this several times. This will help rid your nasal passages of any excess mucus and remaining saline solution. If you find yourself experiencing delayed drainage often, do not rinse right before leaving your house or going to bed.
Caution against using homemade salt mixtures with NeilMed
medical devices:
Homemade solutions may have incorrect concentrations, leading to inadequate relief or even nasal congestion. Additionally, store bought table salt and baking soda are not pharmaceutical grade compounds for medical use and may contain impurities.
