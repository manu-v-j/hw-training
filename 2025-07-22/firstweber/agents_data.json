At just 20 years old, I built and purchased my first home on Madison's west side. That experience showed me how life-changing (and overwhelming) the home-buying process can be. I knew I wanted to help others navigate through that same journey with less stress and more confidence. Whether you're just beginning to dream about buying a home or ready to start the process, I'm here to support you every step of the way. About Me \n \n Both my parents are Army veterans and I was born on base in Landstuhl, Germany, but I grew up in and refer to Wausau, WI, and the Northwoods as home. \n I have two dogs and two cats and am an active community leader, serving as a delegate for the NAACP Dane County Branch and a committee member for the Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological, and Scientific Olympiad (ACT-SO). \n When not working or volunteering, you can find me doing yard work with my certified digger (my dog Nellie), doing a home project while listening to an audiobook, or trying new coffee shops with friends and family! \n \nJob Experience \n \n Admissions Representative, Office of Admissions and Recruitment, UW-Madison \n Student Support Services Coordinator, Madison Area Technical College \n \nEducation \n \n BA in History, University of Wisconsin-Madison (On, Wisconsin!) \n \nMemberships \n \n National Association of Realtors (NAR) \n Wisconsin Realtors Association (WRA) \n Realtors Association of South Central Wisconsin (RASCW) \n Multiple Listing Service (MLS)",

Generally speaking, that is not something you want to hear from your doctor. Fortunately, the cure rate was high for his type of cancer and he has been cancer free for the past 36 years. Having cancer at the age of 24 puts a lot of things in perspective, so Brian doesn't worry about the little things in life. He would rather spend his time helping you find the big things in life like helping you find your dream home. Brian retired from the construction industry in 2020, having spent the last 44 years as a home remodeler in his families business. His construction background gives him a distinct advantage when it comes to checking out potential homes for his clients.

    "description": "Some common questions I hear from Clients.  Where are you from?  My Dad was in sales, so we moved several times while I was growing up, Illinois, Ohio, Southern California. I went to high school and college in North Carolina, and have lived in Wisconsin since 1998.  How did you get into real estate?  I spent the first 20 years of my career in healthcare in varying capacities; sales, business development, administration, and consulting. I have always enjoyed the process of working with a Client to turn an idea or a dream into a reality.I obtained my license in 2016 and began working with First Weber Group at that time.  What do you enjoy most about your career?  To me, the most important part of the \"deal\" is developing a relationship with my Client. Understanding what they want, developing a strategy, and earning their trust. Anyone can sell you something. The best Realtors invest the time and energy to become a trusted advisor and resource for their Clients.  When you are not at work?  I am the proud father of three adult children, and I live in Middleton. In my free time I enjoy, yoga, mountain biking, paddleboarding, motorcycles, seeing live music, and spending time with friends.  BS Appalachian State University, Boone NC MBA Edgewood College School of Business, Madison WI   National Realtor Association   Wisconsin Realtor Association  South-central Wisconsin MLS",

    "description": "*Licensed Realtor in Wisconsin  *Member of Wisconsin Realtors Association   *Member of National Association of Realtors   \n As a Buyer's Agent, the most important thing is to listen to the needs of the client in all facets of purchasing a home. Staging the home home is critical for marketing purposes when working with a Seller and the goal is to make the home visually appealing so the Buyer falls in love at first glance. When working with clients, it is most enjoyable to build a relationship; listening to their stories and seeing the joy they have when starting a new chapter in their life creates an excitement and passion for this job that is never ending. Communication is a crucial step in purchasing and selling a home between myself and my clients.  When I am not working with clients, I am proud wife and mother of two children and three energetic black labs. My family and I enjoy taking trips to our cottage in Northern Wisconsin, where we enjoy spending time outdoors all seasons of the year. When I am not busy working or tending to my children's schedules, I enjoy spending time in my flower gardens.",

    "description": "Oi is passionate about real estate. Being a native Madisonian for 35 plus years, her lifelong residency gives her the leverage, expertise, and enthusiasm to ensure a successful real estate transaction for her clients.  Oi joined First Weber for the wealth of information on hand and the support of the office that made her feel welcomed. Oi’s hardworking, ambitious attitude, coupled with her true passion for making a difference in her community, led her to become an early childhood educator and trustworthy advocate for children, especially those facing diversity.  She has experience supporting a general contractor in new construction and remodeling, which will benefit her work with her clients.  Her keen aptitude pulled from her sincere interest in the industry, mixed with her patient approach and ability to guide her clients with compassion, makes her a tremendous asset to empower her to become a market expert and help her clients sell or buy their dream home.  Outside of real estate, she is a mother of 2 children who enjoys exploring Wisconsin and traveling. She loves to cook and enjoys sampling all of Madison’s eclectic food and spending time with family and friends.",

    "description": "A little bit about me... My passion for great service is what sets me apart in this business: 5-Star, A+, Red Carpet customer service! My focus when working with clients is making the process as smooth as possible while helping them reach their real estate goals. We all know that buying and selling a home can be emotional. Let me help make it a little smoother, and feel way more personal than just a sales transaction! My background includes experience in corporate Customer Service and Inside Sales.  After that, I spent several years at home raising 3 busy kids.  Now I've combined my passion for helping others with my customer service skills in a second (or third?) career as a Realtor. Away from work I enjoy traveling with my family, lake life, and reading.  I'm a huge baseball fan and a big dog lover.  And yes, I also watch a lot of HGTV!  Let's connect to see how I can help you! \nMore information about me.",

    "description": "Home is where your Story Begins!  Your home should tell the story of who you are; so let me begin with a little bit about myself. My name is Corey Tousey and I have been a resident of Washington County my entire life, and I am happy to call it home!  My career in Real Estate began in 2010 short time after I turned the age of 21. As i entered into the real estate community many agents were on their way out. The housing market was still in recovery mode with Short sales and Foreclosures consuming the market. I took that opportunity to really take my time to expand and learn all of the major ins/outs of selling real estate. Closing mainly only deals that were owned by banking institutions helped me grow fast in this career.  Every real state transaction from day one has been unique/ challenging/ and rewarding! I assure you that with my experiences with foreclosures and short sales; my knowledge and strengths will be shown to you throughout our relationship!i From your first to last home, I will do my best to listen to your NEEDS and WANTS, and make sure that we find the best property for you! Buying and selling real estate can complicated and stressful! I am here anytime day or night to take all of your concerns away!  I look forward to working with you!  Sincerely,  Corey D. Tousey",

    "description": "Hi! My name is Cory. I grew up on the country roads of Hartford WI and love the small city/town atmosphere. With just a short drive you can be in any of Wisconsin's big cities including Madison, Milwaukee and the Fox Valley, enjoy your day and the nightlife they have to offer and return home to the beautiful quiet countryside and small town homes that Wisconsin has to offer. I love the variety of landscapes our state has to offer from open farm fields to rolling hills in Baraboo. I especially love to see and show others the variety of homes that people have built over the past century and the story these homes have. For example the home I grew up in is well over 100 years old and has now been remodeled by my parents with some help from my siblings and me and now takes the brick dairy farmhouse to a new level of a place to call home.  Buying a home can be intimidating with paperwork when it is not something you have ever done before or even if you have because it is not something most people deal with on a regular basis and when it comes time to the paperwork it may seem like you're signing your life away but I can tell you that once someone breaks it all down for you it really is not very hard for anyone to understand.  I will be with you every step of the way to explain what you should be expecting and to make it super simple to understand so that when you are working to get into your next home it is as stress free and exciting as possible because that is how buying your home should be.  I am just as excited to be working with you as you are about buying your new home.",

Her interest in home cooking and gourmet a little on the wild side stems from a 6 year background in the restaurant business and her skills are often requested by friends and family when undertaking large gatherings. This lead to the opening of a new business, White River Market Place (website and Facebook page). A Co-op of Artists, plants, bakery and specialty products. The shop is located on her property on the White River in Neshkoro that she freely shares. Her favorite down time is kicking back and soaking up the tranquil natural beauty and wild life that she considers a precious gift and working her land and gardens.

    "description": "Meet Tara Wilde Real estate is in my blood. I guess you could say it always has held a special place in my life. From my earliest days, I can recall playing under the desk of my grandfather at his New Glarus real estate agency some 35 years ago, and spending countless hours with my mother at the office learning the business from the inside out.  My many years of experience are to your benefit, because I want to use the expertise I’ve gained to create special memories for you and your family! Isn’t that what is important? Finding the home where your children will take their first steps. Selling your house and using the profit to take your ultimate dream vacation. Securing land for your hunting adventures or getaway destination. I want to be a part of making those dreams a reality for you, and I will go to whatever lengths are required.  My grandfather used to compare my tenacity to that of a “dog with a bone.” He's right. I’m tenacious in my approach, from securing the best possible selling price for your home, to using my expert negotiation skills to get you the home you want at the price you want. I pride my self on listening to my clients needs and wants when looking for a new home, along with my attention to detail I will guarantee nothing slips through the cracks. With over 500 successful transactions, 23 years of broker experience and an intimate knowledge of the area, I am the real estate broker who clients can feel comfortable reffering to their friends and family. Let me help you make some new memories! \n Tara is simply the best! I recently bought one house and sold my current one in the course of two weeks. In each case, the contract was signed within two days, thanks to Tara's expertise, understanding of the market, and carefully considered advice on how to move effectively and efficiently. I trusted her judgement, and she made the quick turnaround much less stressful than it otherwise would have been. I highly recommend Tara - she's the only realtor I'd use in this area! ~ Don H It may be a bit odd to leave a review before our experience is even complete, but I can't help myself. (Don't worry, another review will come later). This is our first time selling a home, and Tara has been amazing to work with -- super responsive, exhaustively thorough, guides you through the process, knows the market and sells your home with the same enthusiasm that we would. Having Tara on your side relieves a lot of anxiety and gives you confidence that everything is happening fairly, on time, and to your greatest benefit. VERY highly recommend her services! ~ Scott   I recently had the pleasure of working with Tara Wilde during the search of my new home. From our initial meeting to the closing day Tara demonstrated the utmost professionalism, market expertise, and commitment to my needs that really made a positive experience. Tara provided valuable insights into the local real estate market helping me make informed decisions about my purchase. I was impressed with Tara’s level of responsiveness keeping my informed at every stage of the transaction. I’m most grateful for her skillful negotiation skills which allowed my Offer to be chosen amongst many other competing Offers. The entire process was stress free thanks to Tara’s guidance and I couldn’t be happier with my new home. Tara is a true professional who I would highly recommend.

    "description": "A lifelong Wisconsin resident, I was born in Lancaster and graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. Before launching my real estate career, I had a thirty-year career as a manufacturing engineer, a skill set that continues to be useful as I work with home buyers and sellers throughout Wisconsin. Both jobs require organization, good communication skills, planning, research, and attention to detail. My clients make important decisions based on the information I provide, so I am committed to making that information accurate and reliable. I enjoy working with people, I particularly like learning about my client's dreams and needs and then helping them figure out a way to fulfill them. I pride myself on always being available for my clients. I answer my phone and text messages at all hours of the day, on weekends, and on holidays.  I spent 7 seasons as an assistant softball coach at Madison College. I was an assistant softball coach for 4 years at Barneveld High School as well as PTO President and coached youth baseball, softball, basketball and football for several years in Barneveld and Mt. Horeb. If you're considering a move to, from, or within Mt. Horeb, Barneveld, Green Lake, Markesan, Iowa, Dane, Green Lake, Marquette or surrounding Counties, contact me to find out how I can assist you. My goal is to make you feel as tho you are my only client.  My wife and I have 2 adult children. A daughter and her husband in Fond du Lac and a son in Tacoma Washington. I enjoy hunting and musky fishing, boating, snowmobiling and spending time with my family. Serving Columbia, Crawford, Dane, Dodge, Grant, Green, Green Lake, Marquette, Richland, Sauk and surrounding Counties.",

    "description": "About Teresa Kufahl My core belief is that family is always first. I was born, raised, married, and live in Marquette County. My husband and I have 3 adult boys along with 2 grandchildren.  As a family we enjoy watching high school basketball and the Packers, attending one of many different car shows as the “Portage Tire Group”, or celebrating our birthdays at our favorite Mexican restaurant. I am a die-hard bow hunter. I enjoy the peaceful evenings watching nature and sunsets from the deer stand, until the weather turns cold.  That’s when you will find me indoors with a cup of coffee in one hand and a good fairytale book in the other.  During the day I work at Marquette County Clinical Services as the administrative assistant for Human Services, where I pride myself on being organized, reliable, and 100% honest.  When other agents are done for the day, I am logging on to First Weber’s unlimited marketing tools that are all at my fingertips. My promise as your First Weber agent is to continue to be myself during our working relationship.  I will be organized, reliable, and honest in all transactions.

    "description": "About Me  I fell in love with the Lakeland area as a young boy while fishing, camping, and hiking, etc. over 50 years ago. And, when I was finally able to land my first legal muskie \"up north\", I knew I wanted to live in the Northwoods someday. I received a B.S. degree in water chemistry from UW-Stevens Point in 1988 that, in addition to a minor in chemistry, included courses in limnology (the study of freshwater bodies), fisheries, etc. After completing college and initially working in the Milwaukee area in environmental engineering, I was lucky enough to receive an offer to work as a Senior Project Manager for an environmental consulting and engineering firm in Minocqua in 1994. But, fortunately for those of us who live here, there are few contaminated properties to clean \"up north\". So, in 1999 my company closed it's Minocqua Branch office.  Knowing I could never be happy living elsewhere, I worked in a lot of different capacities since then. My 5 full years as a fishing guide (and winter-time substitute teacher) really expanded my knowledge of the area, particularly many of the 2,200 lakes in the immediate area. My tenure as a site acquisition agent for cell phone tower companies caused me to get my real estate license in 2007. During this career I gained invaluable experience in complex lease negotiations and obtaining zoning approvals for frequently contentious cell phone tower projects. Now, after first being approached by a local real estate broker to become a realtor in 1999, I have finally made the exciting decision that the timing was right. I am confident that my educational and work experiences, and my knowledge and love for this area will be an asset for buyers and sellers of real estate.",

His experiences during his formative years, assisting with various aspects of his father's work, equipped him with a solid foundation in real estate principles and practices. Now a vital member of the Tommy Van Ess Realty Group, Devon brings a unique blend of inherited wisdom and personal flair to his role. His understanding of the industry, combined with his own experiences and insights, allows him to offer a fresh yet knowledgeable perspective to clients.

    "description": "About Morgan Barthen Hi! I’m Morgan! I’ve been helping families buy and sell homes and investments with peace of mind since 2017, and I can’t believe how lucky I am to have found my “forever” job so early in my life. Whether you’re looking for advice, starting on your journey towards wealth creation, or ready to retire and move on to the next chapter in your life, I’m here to provide advanced guidance on whatever journey you’re on. Choosing me to represent you means that you’ll be in control of your outcome. I perform with a no-pressure attitude and I empower my clients to make good decisions by teaching them the ins and outs of the buying and selling process. I love saying “yes” and finding pathways to my client's preferred outcome. My clients get the energy and drive of a younger agent combined with the experience, patience, and knowledge that can only be developed by helping hundreds of clients get to their next home. Each agent that you meet will bring unique skills to your partnership. My strengths are found in my honed negotiation skills and strategies, my “big picture” creative thinking, and my deep knowledge of property conditions. I want to be able to be your advocate and friend during the stressful time that comes along with moving. Let's see if we would make a good team. Tell me about your goals, and together, we will make a plan to achieve them!

    "description": "I was born and raised in Bosnia and Herzegovina. My family and I spent nearly 4 years living in Germany as refugees during the Bosnian civil unrest in the early to mid 1990's. In 1997, we moved to Greenfield, WI. I attended Greenfield High School where I graduated in 1998. After graduation I enrolled at the University of Wisconsn Milwaukee where I obtained my Bachelors' degree in Business Administration Marketing and a Certificate in International Business. I spent my first career working in the hospitality and food service industry. I managed single units as a General Manager in the Milwaukee, Racine, Kenosha and Burlington areas. I also oversaw multiple units as a Regional Manager. I have a passion for customer service and my ultimate goal is to always get the best possible outcome for my clients. During my time in the hospitality industry, I have always been involved in real estate in some capacity, including as a part time real estate agent. As my family grew and my priorities changed, I decided to make the leap and become a full-time real estate agent in 2019. I joined First Weber in May 2019. My goal as a First Weber agent is to keep your best interests top of mind, as well as make sure your needs are met during the entire real estate process. I will be there every step of the way as your real estate resource to answer any questions you might have about buying or selling your home.

    "description": "Tony Mattice – Your Forever Realtor Hi, I’m Tony Mattice, a newly licensed real estate agent with First Weber, and I’m excited to help you on your homeownership journey! Whether you’re searching for the perfect place to call home or ready to sell your current property, I’ll be your trusted advocate every step of the way. My goal isn’t just to assist you with one transaction—it’s to earn your trust and become your  FOREVER Realtor , the one you confidently refer to friends and family. Your real estate needs are my  MISSION CRITICAL  priority, and I won’t stop working until I exceed your expectations. \n Before stepping into real estate, I spent over 20 years in retail leadership, working my way up from a part-time associate to  Senior Store Manager  at Jos A. Bank, a sister company of Men’s Wearhouse. Throughout my career, I honed skills in  leadership, urgency, and world-class customer service , but most importantly, I discovered my passion for serving clients. I’ve had the honor of helping people look their best for life’s biggest moments—from proms to weddings—and now, I’m excited to help clients with one of life’s most significant milestones:  buying or selling a home. \n My journey to real estate was a dream I finally made a reality, thanks to the unwavering support of my loving wife. I’ll always be grateful for her encouragement as I pursued this new chapter. \n When I’m not working, you’ll find me  camping and traveling  with my family—we’re happiest near the water, whether it’s  boating, floating, or swimming . I also have a passion for mixology, thanks to my time working at a tiki bar. In fact, my love for tiki culture runs so deep that I even built a  tiki bar in my rec room! \n I can’t wait to help you navigate your real estate journey with the same energy, dedication, and personalized service that I’ve built my career on. Let’s make your next move a success.",
