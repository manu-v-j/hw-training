As i entered into the real estate community many agents were on their way out. The housing market was still in recovery mode with Short sales and Foreclosures consuming the market. I took that opportunity to really take my time to expand and learn all of the major ins/outs of selling real estate. Closing mainly only deals that were owned by banking institutions helped me grow fast in this career.Every real state transaction from day one has been unique/ challenging/ and rewarding! I assure you that with my experiences with foreclosures and short sales; my knowledge and strengths will be shown to you throughout our relationship!i From your first to last home, I will do my best to listen to your NEEDS and WANTS, and make sure that we find the best property for you!

My name is Cory. I grew up on the country roads of Hartford WI and love the small city/town atmosphere. With just a short drive you can be in any of Wisconsin's big cities including Madison, Milwaukee and the Fox Valley, enjoy your day and the nightlife they have to offer and return home to the beautiful quiet countryside and small town homes that Wisconsin has to offer. I love the variety of landscapes our state has to offer from open farm fields to rolling hills in Baraboo. I especially love to see and show others the variety of homes that people have built over the past century and the story these homes have. For example the home I grew up in is well over 100 years old and has now been remodeled by my parents with some help from my siblings and me and now takes the brick dairy farmhouse to a new level of a place to call home.Buying a home can be intimidating with paperwork when it is not something you have ever done before or even if you have because it is not something most people deal with on a regular basis and when it comes time to the paperwork it may seem like you're signing your life away but I can tell you that once someone breaks it all down for you it really is not very hard for anyone to understand.I will be with you every step of the way to explain what you should be expecting and to make it super simple to understand so that when you are working to get into your next home it is as stress free and exciting as possible because that is how buying your home should be.I am just as excited to be working with you as you are about buying your new home.", "website": "https://corylentz.firstweber.com", "email": "", "image_url": "https://content.mediastg.net/dynamic/RealEstate/company/716/account/759414/759414_01192024173149.jpg", "agent_phone_numbers": "262-442-2386", "office_phone_number": "", "social": {"facebook": "", "linkedin": "", "twitter": ""}, "country": "United States"}

I guess you could say it always has held a special place in my life. From my earliest days, I can recall playing under the desk of my grandfather at his New Glarus real estate agency some 35 years ago, and spending countless hours with my mother at the office learning the business from the inside out.My many years of experience are to your benefit, because I want to use the expertise I’ve gained to create special memories for you and your family! Isn’t that what is important? Finding the home where your children will take their first steps. Selling your house and using the profit to take your ultimate dream vacation. Securing land for your hunting adventures or getaway destination. I want to be a part of making those dreams a reality for you, and I will go to whatever lengths are required.My grandfather used to compare my tenacity to that of a “dog with a bone.” He's right. I’m tenacious in my approach, from securing the best possible selling price for your home, to using my expert negotiation skills to get you the home you want at the price you want. I pride my self on listening to my clients needs and wants when looking for a new home, along with my attention to detail I will guarantee nothing slips through the cracks.With over 500 successful transactions, 23 years of broker experience and an intimate knowledge of the area, I am the real estate broker who clients can feel comfortable reffering to their friends and family.Let me help you make some new memories!Tara is simply the best! I recently bought one house and sold my current one in the course of two weeks. In each case, the contract was signed within two days, thanks to Tara's expertise, understanding of the market, and carefully considered advice on how to move effectively and efficiently. I trusted her judgement, and she made the quick turnaround much less stressful than it otherwise would have been. I highly recommend Tara - she's the only realtor I'd use in this area!~Don HIt may be a bit odd to leave a review before our experience is even complete, but I can't help myself. (Don't worry, another review will come later). This is our first time selling a home, and Tara has been amazing to work with -- super responsive, exhaustively thorough, guides you through the process, knows the market and sells your home with the same enthusiasm that we would. Having Tara on your side relieves a lot of anxiety and gives you confidence that everything is happening fairly, on time, and to your greatest benefit. VERY highly recommend her services!~ScottI recently had the pleasure of working with Tara Wilde during the search of my new home. From our initial meeting to the closing day Tara demonstrated the utmost professionalism, market expertise, and commitment to my needs that really made a positive experience. Tara provided valuable insights into the local real estate market helping me make informed decisions about my purchase. I was impressed with Tara’s level of responsiveness keeping my informed at every stage of the transaction. I’m most grateful for her skillful negotiation skills which allowed my Offer to be chosen amongst many other competing Offers. The entire process was stress free thanks to Tara’s guidance and I couldn’t be happier with my new home. Tara is a true professional who I would highly recommend.

And, when I was finally able to land my first legal muskie \"up north\", I knew I wanted to live in the Northwoods someday.I received a B.S. degree in water chemistry from UW-Stevens Point in 1988 that, in addition to a minor in chemistry, included courses in limnology (the study of freshwater bodies), fisheries, etc. After completing college and initially working in the Milwaukee area in environmental engineering, I was lucky enough to receive an offer to work as a Senior Project Manager for an environmental consulting and engineering firm in Minocqua in 1994. But, fortunately for those of us who live here, there are few contaminated properties to clean \"up north\". So, in 1999 my company closed it's Minocqua Branch office.Knowing I could never be happy living elsewhere, I worked in a lot of different capacities since then. My 5 full years as a fishing guide (and winter-time substitute teacher) really expanded my knowledge of the area, particularly many of the 2,200 lakes in the immediate area. My tenure as a site acquisition agent for cell phone tower companies caused me to get my real estate license in 2007. During this career I gained invaluable experience in complex lease negotiations and obtaining zoning approvals for frequently contentious cell phone tower projects.Now, after first being approached by a local real estate broker to become a realtor in 1999, I have finally made the exciting decision that the timing was right. I am confident that my educational and work experiences, and my knowledge and love for this area will be an asset for buyers and sellers of real estate.", "website": "https://JimCheshire.firstweber.com", "email": "", "image_url": "https://content.mediastg.net/dynamic/RealEstate/company/716/account/1458337/1458337_02252025191422.jpg", "agent_phone_numbers": "715-892-4223", "office_phone_number": "", "social": {"facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/Jimthelakeguy", "linkedin": "", "twitter": ""}, "country": "United States"}

We certainly picked the right realtor to list our home. We cannot say enough about how much she did for us during the sale of our property. It was such a pleasure working with her. She stayed on top of everything, advising us and keeping us up-to-date on every detail. Because of her overall knowledge and expertise, we would highly recommend her to anyone. God bless her for all her thoughtfulness.\"Armand & Dolores\"We want to take this opportunity to let you know what an exemplary employee you have.

We couldn't have asked for a better or more professional realtor or Real Estate Company. Many, many thanks.\"Mike & Dawn\"Beverly was a delight to work with.

Geboy. Her effort, concern and hard work are worth much more! It is rare to find someone like Sharon. My family and I feel fortunate and blessed to have had the opportunity to work with her. We are also proud to have the privilege of calling her 'friend'.\"Steve & Polly\"Sharon was very kind and fair with us. We enjoyed doing business with her. Sharon is definitely an asset to your company!\"Donna & Burt\"We cannot express how much we have enjoyed working with Sharon. She is the best! Your company should be honored to have her as your employee.\"Deb & Pat\"Sharon was a joy to work with! She kept me informed as soon as new properties were available and was patient with me over several months of search.\"Tony \"Sharon was excellent. She realized the property I wanted and showed me the house I purchased. She always made certain I was satisfied and all my questions and concerns were handled promptly and courteously.\"Redean", "website": "https://sharongeboy.firstweber.com", "email": "", "image_url": "https://content.mediastg.net/dynamic/RealEstate/company/716/account/727245/727245_05172022132500.jpg", "agent_phone_numbers": "262-679-5418", "office_phone_number": "", "social": {"facebook": "", "linkedin": "", "twitter": ""}, "country": "United States"}
