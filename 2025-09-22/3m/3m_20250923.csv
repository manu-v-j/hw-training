Non-woven material finishes and provides consistency and conformability. Contoured part finishing The Benefits of 3M Precision Shaped Grain and Scotch Brite™ Web When top product performance is the bottom line, we recommend our Scotch-Brite™ Deburr and Finish PRO Flap Brush for cleaning and finishing. We designed this flap brush with all the benefits operators have come to expect from our Scotch-Brite™ abrasives, including load resistance and responsive open web that produces an even, consistent finish. What sets this brush apart from other Scotch Brite™ abrasives is 3M Precision Shaped Grain (PSG). This proprietary mineral — coated throughout the abrasive — is engineered for hardness and strength for an exceptionally fast and consistent cut. The sharp-cutting mineral is counteracted by soft, buoyant nylon fibers that respond to surface irregularities and contours. Gaps between fibers allow debris to escape and help minimize loading. Together, the web and mineral combine to aggressively tackle the substrate without sacrificing predictable results. It produces fine finishes on stainless steel and can clean brass and aluminum to provide a bright finish. The Outstanding Performance of 3M Precision Shaped Grain 3M Precision Shaped Grain is produced using 3M technology to create triangular shaped ceramic mineral grains. The razor-sharp corners of each triangle act like individual cutting tools that slice through metal, and continuously shelf-sharpen as the points break off, ensuring extended high performance in heavy-duty production applications. The grains wear evenly and provide extra-long life and consistency with less grinding pressure. The result is that our PSG products outcut and outlast conventional ceramic industrial abrasive products, maximizing productivity and minimizing operator fatigue. Blending finishes back into fabricated metal The Anatomy of Flap Brushes We engineer the Scotch-Brite™ Deburr & Finish PRO Flap Brush by adhering individual sheets of nonwoven abrasive material to a fiber core at a 90 degree angle. Under normal use (abiding by recommended RPMs), the brush minimizes chatter risk. As it spins, flaps rotate centrifugally and make continuous contact with the workpiece. By lapping the surface, the flaps eliminate the residual traces or marks that tend to be left by singular discs or discs ganged on a shaft. A flap brush may be used with a variety of tools, including backstands, 3M™ Match and Finish Sander, and Inline Sanders. The Many Advantages of Scotch-Brite™ Abrasives Nonwoven technology makes our Scotch-Brite™ industrial abrasives unique. A combination of fiber strands, resin, and abrasive mineral forms a thick, open web. The spring-like nature of the fibers responds to contours and effectively removes unwanted burrs, soils, and contaminants while maintaining the geometry of the workpiece, which in turn reduces rework and boosts productivity. Gaps in the web allow swarf to escape, so debris does not clog the mineral. Fibers in the web continually break down with use to reveal fresh mineral for exceptional consistency and long service life. Scotch-Brite™ products may enhance productivity while reducing the need for cleaning chemicals and wire brushes.

Designed with aluminum oxide and a grinding aid on a durable X- weight cloth backing, this roll is available in grades from A300 to A30. Macroreplicated structure provides long product life and consistent cut and finish 3M™ Trizact™ Abrasive surface, 50x magnification Long Life, Sustained Cut, Consistent Performance Our 3M™ Trizact™ Cloth Roll 337DC owes its durability and extremely consistent and sustained cut rate to its uniquely engineered ""bricks and channels"" macroreplicated abrasive structure. Uniform abrasive ""bricks"" keep fresh cutting mineral constantly at the working surface and ""channels"" sweep debris away to discourage loading and keep the substrate clean. The ""bricks"" consist of layers of mineral and grinding aid, up to 4 times as much as aluminum oxide mineral of the same grade. These dense layers of abrasive mineral lead to extra-long life and extremely consistent performance. The grinding aid protects heat-sensitive alloys from damage and reducing rework. Trizact abrasives start sharp and stay sharp. The consistent cut they deliver can often consolidate or eliminate process steps. Microreplication: Engineering Surface Geometry Building upon the principles of microreplication, 3M scientists developed larger, more elaborate abrasive structures -- Macroreplication -- pyramids, cubes, spheres, ridges, identical in shape and optimized for a variety of applications. Microreplication allows 3M to design abrasives with varying shapes and formulations, to control the level of breakdown, cut, finish and life. These abrasive structures are arrayed precisely and uniformly across a film or cloth backing in a pattern calculated to deliver sustained cut rate and eliminate roll-to-roll variation. Made to Tackle Difficult Metals Trizact was developed especially for finishing more difficult processing materials like titanium, cobalt, stainless steel, as well as other exotic alloys in the aerospace, aviation and medical industries. Originally designed for intermediate finishing applications -- removing slight defects from orthopedic medical implant devices and blending finishes on cast or forged turbine blades -- Trizact 337DC's more consistent cut and longer life in demanding applications make possible more efficient manufacturing processes and lower cost of operation in many metalworking applications. 3M Science. Applied to Creating More Perfect Surfaces. Microreplication is only one of 3M's platform of core technologies. Perfectly calibrated arrays are designed to give materials new physical, chemical, or optical properties. The science that makes 3M's structured abrasives wear more evenly, last longer and provide more pristine finishes on delicate components like medical implants is also the science that makes traffic signs brighter, and exterior building illumination capture and reflect light more brilliantly.

This unique disc can aggressively clean without significantly altering the base material. 3M Die Grinder 20240 with Scotch-Brite™ Clean & Strip Discs Roloc™ Attachment for Swift Disc Changes The Scotch-Brite™ Roloc™ Clean and Strip Disc binds silicon carbide mineral and non-woven nylon fibers using resin. Resin dissolves and breaks down over time, helping the abrasive stay strong and resist heat. With the convenience of the Roloc™ attachment system, disc change-out for multi-step finishing processes is both quick and easy. The disc swiftly mounts to a holder pad (sold separately) which, subsequently attaches to abrasive tools like die grinders and right angle disc sanders. Silicon Carbide Mineral We use silicon carbide in the Scotch-Brite™ Roloc™ Clean and Strip Disc, because it's a very sharp synthetic mineral that is commonly used for low-pressure applications such as paint prep. While it breaks down faster than aluminum oxide, it produces a superior finish. The extra coarse (XCS) mineral works hard to remove unwanted corrosion and blemishes from a variety of substrates. It aggressively removes paint and rust from seams, door jambs, drip moldings, pinchwelds and other difficult-to-reach areas. The Many Benefits of Open Web Abrasives Nonwoven technology makes our Scotch-Brite™ industrial abrasives unique. A combination of fiber strands, resin, and abrasive mineral forms a thick, open web. The spring-like nature of the fibers responds to contours and effectively removes unwanted burrs, soils, and contaminants while maintaining the geometry of the workpiece, which in turn reduces rework and boosts productivity. Gaps in the web allow swarf to escape, so debris does not clog the mineral. Fibers in the web continually break down with use to reveal fresh mineral for exceptional consistency, superior cut performance, and extremely long service life.

This abrasive is specifically designed to provide both strength and flexibility for aggressive use on contoured surfaces, and has numerous features that make this abrasive perfect for use in wet environments with a variety of metal workpieces. Tough and Flexible Finishing The abrasive belts made from 3M™ Trizact™ Cloth Roll 953FA are designed specifically for centerless grinding and fine finishing on a wide range of metals. This abrasive features a tough X-weight polyester cloth backing with enough flex to run smoothly on curved surfaces and the stamina to withstand aggressive use. This backing is also water-resistant, which allows for the use of liquid lubricants for additional heat reduction during use. High-Quality Design Each belt is covered with microreplicated structures containing ceramic aluminum oxide mineral grains, which is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its fast cut-rate and long life. This design cuts consistently fast with consistent finish due to the uniform structure pattern. It also uses a tough resin bonding material that is heat resistant to allow for lasting abrasive life under harsh operating conditions. These attributes make these belts great for flat or centerless finishing applications, which require a sturdy abrasive that is still sensitive to surface irregularities. The Trizact™ Advantage 3M™ Trizact™ Cloth Roll 953FA features an engineered surface of uniformly patterned, three-dimensional structures resembling pyramids. As the abrasive is used, the tops of the pyramids wear away, continually exposing fresh mineral. This cycle of renewal ensures a consistent cut-rate and finish throughout the long life of the abrasive.",https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/v000220013/,"{'Abrasive Material': 'Ceramic Aluminum Oxide', 'Backing Material': 'Polyester Cloth', 'Backing Weight': 'XF Weight', 'Bond Type': 'Resin', 'Brands': '3M', 'Micron Grade': 'A45', 'Product Form': 'Roll'}",https://cdmsweb.3m.com/ingredientcommunication/file/Media/+XsRH56WquU=,,,

Fast Cut, Long Life We use aluminum oxide abrasive mineral in the manufacture of our 3M™ Stikit™ Film Sheet 375L. Aluminum oxide is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its fast cut-rate and long life. This mineral makes a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges, whereas traditional natural abrasives dull more quickly. Due to its fast cut-rate, hardness, and strength, it is widely used in grinding applications in addition to sanding and finishing applications. Aluminum oxide is suitable for a wide variety of materials in both woodworking and metalworking, including ferrous alloys. For all of the above reasons, the 3M™ Stikit™ Film Sheet 375L is a reliable, high-performing, and long-lasting solution for many different applications.

What makes this abrasive unique is the naturally-occurring mineral that's used: cerium oxide. It helps with glass defect repair and acrylic solid surface finishing by minimizing gouging. For glass defect repair, polyester and acrylic solid surface finishing 3M™ Trizact™ Abrasive surface, 50x magnification Finish and Repair Sensitive Surfaces We engineered 3M™ Trizact™ PSA Film Sheet 568XA with defect repair in mind. Sensitive surfaces, like glass and acrylic, require an abrasive that cuts aggressively without significantly gouging or scratching the surface. The mineral, adhered to a PSA backing using microreplication technology, cuts consistently and produces a high gloss level, which is often desirable during surface finishing. What's more — the film backing is water resistant and requires little water for touch-up, minimizing mess and processing steps. About Cerium Oxide One of the secrets to this product's success is cerium oxide. The average grain size of the particle is measured in nanometers in raw form, thus making it one of the most effective abrasives for final polishing steps on solid surfaces. It is heat resistant and effective as a polishing agent for glass mirrors, plate glass, crystal, television tubes, ophthalmic lenses, precision optics and precious and semiprecious stone. The Trizact Advantage 3M offers a product that not only gets the job done, it offers durability and sharp cut for longevity, helping to reduce the hassle of frequently replacing abrasive product. Unlike conventional abrasives, 3M™ Trizact™ products start sharp and stay sharp, resulting in more predictable finishes and improved, consistent quality. 3M™ Trizact™ products last longer than conventional abrasives and provide precise finish control such that operators can reduce grade sequences, requiring fewer process steps and fewer abrasive products. Three-dimensional structures uniformly distributed over the entire surface ensure consistent performance and eliminate product-to-product variation. Precise and Consistent Abrasive Surface Here's how it works: 3M™ Trizact™ Abrasives feature an engineered surface of patterned, microscopic three-dimensional structures resembling pyramids. As the abrasive is used, the tops of the pyramids wear away, continually exposing fresh abrasive. This ensures a consistent cut rate and finish throughout the long life of the 3M™ Trizact™ Film Roll 568XA.

The Stikit™ roll should be used in conjunction with our 3M™ Stikit™ backup pad (sold separately) that is attached to the sander. Aluminum Oxide Abrasive Aluminum oxide is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its fast cut-rate and long life. This mineral makes a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges, whereas traditional natural abrasives dull more quickly. Due to its fast cut-rate, hardness, and strength, it is widely used for sanding and finishing applications. Aluminum oxide is suitable for use on a wide variety of materials. Designed to Resist Loading Sanding rolls cut better and last longer when dust isn't clogging the cutting surface of the abrasives. Open coat construction means the abrasive grains are placed with space between them to help evacuate dust and other sanding debris and avoid clogging the cutting edge of the grains. This allows the sheet to continue cutting even when sanding metals, paints, and other materials that would, otherwise, clog the grain and hinder sanding ability. Additionally, the open coat feature provides a more aggressive cut than a comparable closed coat abrasive of the same grade. All of this adds up to increased productivity and reduced material consumption.

With its outstanding cut, durability, and ease of use, this disc offers a step up in performance over conventional fiber discs. Constructed with a grinding aid, it is an excellent choice for weld removal, blending, and finish refinement on stainless steel and high nickel alloys. The sharpness of 3M precision-shaped grain delivers a high initial cut The Advanced Solution for Challenging Applications Balance cost and output by selecting the abrasive with precisely the right amount of cut and life, no more and no less. 3M™ Fibre Disc 787C (PDF, 395 Kb) contains the exact amount of precision shaped grain (PSG) you need to optimize the balance of speed and longevity for challenging applications from grinding to deburring. Moreover, to keep the disc and workpiece cool, a grinding aid is incorporated, further prolonging disc life. Disc construction includes a stiff fiber backing and strong resin bond that provide durability and tear-resistance, which along with abrasive grain enables operators to complete more parts per disc and requires fewer disc changes. The exceptional life and cut of our 787C Fibre Disc make it one of 3M's best grinding discs for high production environments, providing significant gains over conventional fiber discs. When our highest-tier fiber disc may be under-utilized but productivity is still your bottom line, our 787C Fibre Disc delivers outstanding throughput. This fiber disc is an excellent choice for a range of applications such as: Edge chamfering Beveling Deburring Weld removal Step Up Production with 3M Precision Shaped Grain Developed for improved output on light to heavy stock removal, 3M Precision Shaped Grain lets operators finish tough tasks faster and with less fatigue. It wears evenly, and because the abrasive itself stays cooler and sharper, PSG abrasives last significantly longer than their conventional ceramic counterparts, ensuring extended high performance in production applications. To accomplish this level of performance, 3M engineers apply proprietary microreplication technology to create precise triangular structures of 3M™ Ceramic Abrasive Grain, and then electrostatically orient them on the backing to form sharp peaks. These ultra-sharp peaks slice cleanly through metal rather than gouging or ""plowing"" as conventional abrasives do, and continuously self-sharpen as the points break off. Quick Change Attachments Choice of Power Tool Attachment To suit many different project needs, we offer these discs in a range of sizes and a variety of attachment styles. Larger sized discs have a 7/8 inch center hole and require the use of a 3M™ disc pad face plate and hub, which are attached to a right angle grinder (PDF, 5.1 Mb) with a disc retainer nut (all sold separately). GL and TN quick change attachments are an option for 4-1/2 inch to 7 inch discs. Smaller sized quick change Roloc™ Discs are also available (sold separately) and provide reliable attachment to the tool and easy disc changes between applications. Tips for Optimal Use Fiber discs are heavy-duty abrasives that feature a tough, stiff backing made from vulcanized fiber that resist wear and can handle tough grinding applications. For optimal performance, the disc should be used with a face plate of the appropriate density for the application—a lighter density face plate for lighter weight grinding applications, and a harder density face plate for more heavyweight grinding applications. Using the correct face plate for the application ensures that the abrasive mineral will re-sharpen, maximizing the life of the abrasive. 3M Engineered for Peak Productivity 3M Abrasives engineers know abrasive construction.

GP+ Wheels maintain wheel shape in the most aggressive applications GP+ Wheels provide high durability for the toughest edge and flat surface deburring applications Recommended Applications The Standard Abrasives ™ General Purpose Plus Wheel is a convolute wheel that winds an open web of abrasive grain, nylon fibers and resin around a core. The wheel provides excellent durability for the toughest edge and flat surface deburring applications. It's great for medium to heavy burr removal on parts with heavy edges and turbine blades. It may also be used for machine and belt mark blending, as well as fine finishing on parts like surgical tools. The wheel utilizes either silicon carbide or aluminum oxide — and are available in medium to hard densities, ranging from 8 to 10. Together, these properties combine to cut aggressively, maintain wheel shape and stand up to edges. Nylon fibers in the open web break down while deburring the surface, exposing fresh, sharp mineral. The wheel breakdown contributes to consistent cutting action. Gaps between the nylon fibers allow swarf and debris to escape, keeping the mineral sharp and preventing blunt or dull edges that might gouge or blemish the surface of the workpiece. Subsequently, smear-resistant finishes result. Tips for Optimal Use As a convolute wheel, the Standard Abrasives™ General Purpose Plus Wheel should run at recommended operating speeds, using low to medium pressure, and in the direction of the arrow imprinted on the wheel. Following these recommended measures will help to ensure operator safety and optimal performance of the wheel.

3M™ Cloth Belt 464W,B40068749,,464W,,https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1362394J/J.jpg,3M,"3M™ Cloth Belt 464W is an abrasive sanding belt constructed on a heavy, YF-weight backing that features closed coat construction for aggressive sanding action. The silicon carbide abrasive, Cork Particles and flexible backing make this cloth an ideal product for metal surface sanding and final cosmetic polish, including the required ""blue"" finish on stainless steel. Provides a very uniform finish throughout the life of the belt Tough Sanding and Finishing Belt Our 3M™ Cloth Belt 464W is best suited for metal sanding and finishing thanks to its durability and fast cutting abrasive material. Its heavy, polyester cloth backing provides smooth operation and durability and can conform to the shape of contoured parts for consistent finishing. The abrasive side features closed coat construction for aggressive sanding and a distinct blue-black color helps to easily differentiate it from other grits and grains. Silicon Carbide is a hard mineral, yet fractures easily to provide a sharp edge Silicon Carbide Abrasive This paper primarily uses silicon carbide, which is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its fast cut-rate and smooth finish. This synthetic mineral is very hard and fractures easily, resulting in freshly exposed sharp edges that cut extra fast and produce a smooth, professional-looking finish. Silicon carbide products are commonly used for low-pressure applications such as cleaning and finishing on wood and metal. While it wears faster than aluminum oxide, it produces a finer finish. Waterproof and Heat Resistant This sheet also uses a resin bonding which is specially designed to resist thermal and chemical deterioration, which can occur during sanding. This bond is very tough and excellent for precision work on hard and soft surfaces. This also allows for faster sanding and a higher cut rate. The waterproof polyester backing material enables the user to rinse areas of the workpiece and the cloth during use to prevent dust and debris from clogging the points of the abrasive, while producing a faster cut at the same time.

Hard, Tough and Sharp 3M's fastest cutting, longest lasting abrasive saves labor costs and improves quality. Aluminum oxide is popular among collision repair professionals because of its fast cut-rate and long life. This natural mineral makes a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges, keeping it sharper longer than traditional natural abrasives. Aluminum oxide is suitable for a wide variety of metalworking materials including ferrous alloys. These sheets featuring aluminum oxide abrasive let technicians sand faster to improve productivity and reduce labor costs, and the consistent finish reduces rework. Technicians simply snap the sheet off at the perforations to match the job needed Our Kiss-Cut Underscore Technology The unique Kiss-cut Underscore Technology enables technicians to quickly and easily convert Purple abrasive sheet rolls into multiple sheet-length configurations. Sheets are perforated to match a range of accessories. Technicians simply snap the sheet off at the perforations to most closely match the hand or file board for each specific application. This makes for more effective sanding and reduces material waste. Chevron Hole Configurations To achieve maximum performance, 3M has added small holes that have been purposely arranged on the sheet in a chevron formation. This configuration of holes allows for optimal particulate removal from the face of the sheet, improving performance when used with or without a dust extraction system. When using dust extraction, sheet alignment is not necessary to achieve direct air flow from the panel through the abrasive sheet, saving time. Our Hookit™ Attachment System 3M offers a complete line of hook-and-loop style Hookit™ sheets for work spaces where adhesive backing may become contaminated by dust, dirt, or flying debris. Hookit™ sheets conveniently and firmly attach to a hook-and-loop backup hand or file board (sold separately). It's simple: just slap the sheet on and start sanding. It removes just as cleanly and easily, and can be re-used again and again for the extent of the abrasive life.

Aluminum oxide is suitable for a wide variety of materials in both woodworking and metalworking, including ferrous alloys. Our 3M™ Stikit™ discs come ready to use with a pressure sensitive adhesive coating on the backside so that attaching them to the disc pad is as simple as pressing on a sticker. The disc can be peeled off of the disc pad just as easily, leaving a clean surface for your next disc. Stikit disc rolls offer the convenience of tearing off a disc and eliminate the need for a liner. A Stikit disc should be used in conjunction with a 3M Stikit backup pad (also called a disc pad and sold separately) that is attached to a disc sander, random orbital sander, or stationary disc sander.

It is designed to remove heavy rust, thick paint and corrosion while also scratching the base material underneath, which can save you time. The highly conformable, high-strength fibers resist chunking and loading, and they perform well on edges. Quickly removes weld burn discoloration Take Advantage of High Conformability With its reengineered fiber web, the Scotch-Brite™ Clean and Strip XT Pro Extra Cut Disc allows operators to take advantage of all the benefits that come with increased conformability without compromising strength. With increased conformability, this disc achieves a larger contact area with the workpiece for faster removal rates. It also conforms to weld bead ripples to polish welds without removing them, and works in hard-to-reach areas without damaging the substrate. In addition to its high conformability, the Scotch-Brite™ Clean and Strip XT Pro Extra Cut Disc offers low vibration, decreased chunking, a high speed rating and long life. That all adds up to a disc you can spin onto your angle grinder with confidence. Aluminum oxide quickly removes heavy rust from metal Save Time with Aluminum Oxide We designed our Scotch-Brite™ Clean and Strip XT Pro Extra Cut Disc with aluminum oxide abrasive mineral because of its ability to remove heavy coatings and simultaneously scratch and clean to the bare metal underneath without leaving divots. This means that operators can remove a coating from a workpiece and get it ready for welding or adhesive application with the same disc — saving the time of switching abrasives. Available in multiple sizes for a variety of applications Spongy Web, Sharp Mineral To engineer our Scotch-Brite™ Clean and Strip XT Pro Extra Cut Disc, aluminum oxide mineral is combined with non-woven nylon fibers using resin. Aluminum oxide is a very hard mineral that delivers a high cut rate, commonly used in high-pressure applications like cutting and weld removal. The resin bond strengthens the fiber web and allows it to gradually break down to reveal new fibers and sharp mineral — delivering a consistent cut over the life of the abrasive. The combination of fiber strands, resin and abrasive mineral forms a thick, open web. Gaps in the web allow swarf to escape, minimizing loading of the abrasive.

Scotch-Brite™ Clean and Finish Roll,B40071924,,CF-RL,,https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/51764J/scotch-brite-tm-clean-and-finish-rolls.jpg,Scotch-Brite,"Scotch-Brite™ Clean and Finish Roll delivers consistent results for finishing, blending, polishing, and cleaning on a variety of metals, wood, plastics surfaces as well as hard-to-reach areas. The roll stock can be easily cut to any length. Clean and Finish roll stock provides consistent surface conditioning for the life of the product. Load resistance keeps the abrasive particles exposed to maintain a consistent cut rate. Our general purpose pad can be cut and used by hand for precise control. Wider width stock can be cut and paired with a hand pad holder for uniform finishing, or on an inline or oscillating sander to cover larger areas. We manufacture Scotch-Brite™ Clean and Finish Rolls with a choice of silicon carbide, aluminum oxide, or talc abrasive mineral. Silicon carbide is a synthetic mineral that is very sharp and commonly used for low-pressure applications such as paint prep and finishing. Aluminum oxide is a hard, blocky mineral that provides high cut-rate and long life. While silicon carbide breaks down faster than aluminum oxide, it produces a finer finish. Talc is a mild abrasive that can be used achieve a satin finish or with polish to create a high gloss finish in topcoat rubbing applications. Our Scotch-Brite™ abrasives are unique surface conditioning products with abrasives incorporated into non-woven fiber matrix. Combining abrasives and non-woven material creates an abrasive system that delivers consistent results for the life of the product. The open-web material runs cool and is load resistant, which keeps the abrasive minerals cutting at high performance by limiting clogging of the fibers.

Scotch-Brite™ SC Surface Conditioning Low Stretch Belt,B40071955,,SC-BL,,https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/96783J/scotch-brite-tm-surface-conditioning-belts-a-med.jpg,Scotch-Brite,"Among Scotch-Brite™ SC Surface Conditioning Belts, the Scotch-Brite™ SC Surface Conditioning Low Stretch Belt falls right in the middle in terms of its durability and flexibility. Its moderate strength makes it versatile and useful in many sequences — cutting aggressively without marring the substrate. Designed for cleaning, finishing and light deburring Given that the Scotch-Brite™ Surface Conditioning Low Stretch Belt balances durability with flexibility, it's a good match for cleaning, finishing and light deburring applications. It performs best on steel and stainless steel, carbon, titanium and nickel alloys, but it may also be used on aluminum, copper, brass and soft, non-ferrous metals. We offer the Scotch-Brite™ Surface Conditioning Low Stretch Belt in many variations, so operators can find the right belt for their unique project. Minerals, Grades and Belt Types We engineer the Scotch-Brite™ Surface Conditioning Low Stretch Belt using aluminum oxide and silicon carbide minerals. Combinations include: aluminum oxide medium (A MED), aluminum oxide very fine (A VFN), aluminum oxide coarse (A CRS), silicon carbide medium (S MED), silicon carbide super fine (S SFN), silicon carbide very fine (S VFN). Aluminum oxide cuts softer but lasts longer than silicon carbide. It's a good mineral for projects where a soft scratch is desirable — perhaps on softer metals or workpieces where gouging and undercutting are a primary concern. Conversely, silicon carbide is a good match for projects where a coarser, more aggressive cut is desired. Moving along the spectrum of grades, choose a fine grade for finer finishes and medium or coarse grades for coarser finishes. Our Scotch-Brite™ Surface Conditioning Low Stretch Belt is intended for use in ""low stretch"" applications when a standard scrim belt is stretching on the machine or when less conformability is desired. The low-stretch belt is resistant to wear and sharp edges — rendering it useful in a variety of industries, from transportation to metal fabrication. The belt is available in different types: file, narrow, portable, pump sleeve and wide & flat finishing. Operators should consider tools, surface area, contours and dimensions of a workpiece when choosing a belt. Narrow belts, for example, are commonly used in benchstand and backstand applications. Pump sleeves, on the other hand, are fitted around expander wheels and used for finishing large equipment that cannot be moved. The Many Benefits of Open Web Abrasives Nonwoven technology makes Scotch-Brite™ industrial abrasives unique. A combination of fiber strands, resin and abrasive mineral forms a thick, open web. The spring-like nature of the fibers responds to contours and effectively removes unwanted burrs, soils and contaminants while maintaining the geometry of the workpiece, which in turn reduces rework and boosts productivity. Gaps in the web allow swarf to escape, so debris does not clog the mineral. Fibers in the web continually break down with use to reveal fresh mineral for exceptional consistency, superior cut performance and extremely long service life. Scotch-Brite products not only enhance productivity, but also increase operator. From aesthetic finishing to weld blending, deburring and more, Scotch-Brite abrasives work fast and deliver consistent results, part after part. Scotch-Brite™ Surface Conditioning Belts Overall, operators choose Scotch-Brite™ Surface Conditioning Belts for cleaning, finishing, blending and deburring. The non-woven material combined with abrasive grain is an ideal way to add a great finish or remove burrs while maintaining the geometry of the workpiece.

Our 3M™ Microfinishing Film Roll 373L has a friction coating made with quartz mineral. This coating is anti-slip, so the abrasive won't slip from machines or workpieces — like camshafts, crankshafts and transmission parts — during finishing. The polyester cloth backing is typically stronger than paper backings. It can be run wet on microfinishing machines and stays strong when applied to the oscillating part. Additionally, the abrasive mineral is uniformly distributed over the backing. The strength of the backing, combined with the uniformity of the mineral, helps produce a consistent finish each time you sand. Microfinishing — an important application for many operators — corrects the geometry of parts and creates fine finishes. Microfinishing can remove damaged or amorphous layers to improve the surface finish and roundness of the part. Available in variety of grades, operators should consider target tolerances when selecting the right microfinishing film. We designed Microfinishing Film Roll 373L Type 2 film in a range of colors (PDF, 348 Kb) — reflective of each grade — for added value, helping reduce the risk for error. To improve the geometry of parts and achieve desired finishes, our 3M™ Microfinishing Film Roll 373L is an exceptional choice.

Used dry or with water, 3M™ Wetordry™ Paper Sheets enable the user to rinse areas of the workpiece and the sheet during use to prevent dust and debris from clogging the points of the abrasive and reduce air-borne dust, while producing a faster cut at the same time. These versatile sheets are ideal on surfaces that tend to generate a lot of dust, such as paint and primer; and can also be used dry for finishing metal and gel coats. In the marine industry they are used for sanding old finishes, fine feather edging, and surface work. The standard 9 inch x 11 inch sheets can be cut to size for the application. Silicon carbide is a very hard mineral characterized by sharp points that fracture easily, resulting in freshly exposed sharp edges that cut extra fast and produce a smooth, professional-looking finish. Silicon carbide products are commonly used for low-pressure applications such as paint prep and finishing on wood and metal. While the mineral has a shorter life than aluminum oxide, it produces a superior finish. Our 3M™ Wetordry™ products are backed with our proprietary waterproof paper backing that supports both wet and dry applications. Lighter weight than cloth and smooth rather than textured, paper backing is preferable for lighter applications such as finishing and paint prep. At the same time, many such applications produce a significant amount of dust, clogging the abrasive points and creating an inferior work environment. These effects can be minimized by sanding with water to rinse dust away from the workpiece and the abrasive surface.",https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b40071215/,"{'Abrasive Material': 'Silicon Carbide', 'Application': 'Deburring,Cleaning,Finishing,Surface Preparation', 'Backing Material': 'Paper', 'Backing Weight': 'C Weight', 'Brands': '3M', 'Coat Type': 'Closed Coat', 'Equipment - Machines': 'Hand Sanding', 'Grit': '60,80,100,120,150,180,240,320,400,600', 'Industries': 'Paint Preparation,MRO,Marine,Composite,Metalworking,AOEM', 'Overall Length (Imperial)': '9 in,11 in', 'Overall Length (Metric)': '228.6 mm,279.4 cm', 'Overall Width (Imperial)': '9 in,11 in', 'Overall Width (Metric)': '228.6 mm,279.4 mm', 'Product Color': 'Black', 'Product Form': 'Sheet', 'Sanding Type': 'Wet/Dry,Wet', 'Sub Applications': 'Blending,Paint Stripping,Coating Removal,Paint Removal', 'Sub Industries': 'Metal Fabrication'}",https://cdmsweb.3m.com/ingredientcommunication/file/Media/AUttTIt2rx8=,,"https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/926868O/3m-metalworking-catalogue.pdf?&fn=3M-Metalworking-Catalog-High-Resolution.pdf,https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/148465O/3m-tm-industrial-products-for-woodworking-catalog.pdf?&fn=60-4400-7219-1.pdf",

These discs help to repair light defects, especially in automotive paint applications. Micro-structured silicon carbide on a waterproof film backing 3M™ Trizact™ Abrasive surface, 50x magnification Preparation and Restoration 3M™ Trizact™ Hookit™ Film Disc Roll 466LA is available in three grades: A3, A5, and A7. The abrasive is color-coded by grade to help reduce the likelihood of reaching for the wrong grade during a sequence. The discs in our 3M™ Trizact™ Hookit™ Film Disc Roll 466LA are made with silicon carbide mineral. We chose silicon carbide, a very sharp synthetic mineral, because it is commonly used for low-pressure applications such as paint repair. While it breaks down faster than aluminum oxide, it produces a fine finish that's desirable when prepping or restoring surfaces. Hookit™ Attachment 3M™ Trizact™ Hookit™ Film Discs have hook and loop attachments on the back of the disc. Small tufts of fiber are pulled through scrim on the abrasive to create loops which, subsequently, attach to the hooks on Hook and Loop disc pads. These features makes disc attachment, removal and re-attachment swift and efficient. Moreover, they facilitate use and re-use of the disc for the extent of the abrasive life. 3M™ Science and the Power of Trizact™ Abrasives 3M™ Trizact™ abrasives revitalize light dimensioning and finishing work by reducing processing steps, increasing throughput and creating consistency. Big benefits are achieved through a 3M technology called microreplication. During microreplication, small three-dimensional structures resembling pyramids are adhered to a backing. These ""pyramids"" contain layers of mineral, and they begin to break down after repeated use, continually exposing fresh mineral. The cycle of mineral renewal sustains the abrasive's sharpness. Ongoing sharp cutting action reduces the need to swap out the abrasive, contributing to higher throughput and increased productivity. Additionally, because mineral is uniformly distributed over the abrasive surface, the workpiece receives fixed — rather than erratic — contact for a consistent cut. From medical implants to surgical tools to automotive transmission components, 3M™ Trizact™ abrasives are uniquely suited for projects with acute technical requirements — delivering a consistent finish part after part.

3M™ Cartridge Roll 747D,B40071827,,747D,,https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/524285J/3m-cartridge-rolls-747d.jpg,3M,"The 3M™ Cartridge Roll 747D is ideal for metal finishing in small hard to reach areas like corners or inside pipes. These cartridge rolls feature a blend of aluminum oxide and 3M™ ceramic grain on a strong cotton backing around a solid mandrel core. Available in both tapered and regular designs. Blended Materials that Stay Sharp The surface of the 3M™ Cartridge Roll 747D is covered with blended ceramic materials, which enhances the toughness and hardness of the grain. Perfect for stock removal, ceramic abrasives are engineered to fracture frequently for a super-fast cut and can handle intense heat and stress applications. The ceramic/aluminum oxide blend surpasses aluminum oxide abrasives in cut-rate and durability and makes our 3M™ Cartridge Roll 747D an excellent choice for moderate stock removal and surface preparation. Sturdy Design for Tough Jobs Abrasive grains are attached to the roll using an anti-friction resin bonding material, which helps the abrasive run smoothly over the workpiece. A grinding aid coating is also added to help the abrasive stay cool during grinding, minimizing heat and improving abrasive performance. This attribute, combined with the semi-flexible x-weight backing, make this roll a good match for projects that require a strong sanding tool that can be used with minimal space or leverage. Rolls can also be ordered with tapered ends. The tapered point and small size of tapered rolls enable you to get inside internal diameters and holes, making them great for deburring, blending and polishing in hard-to-reach areas. Multi-layer design enhances abrasive longevity and helps produce a consistent cut Multi-layered Abrasive The multi-layer design of our 3M™ Cartridge Roll 747D keeps it cutting sharp and helps it withstand repeated wear. As top layers wear down over time, underlying layers expose fresh mineral, so that you get a consistent cut on every job. Wrapping multiple layers of resin bonded abrasive material around the roll also contributes to its sturdiness and durability. The closed-coat construction means mineral grains cover 100 percent of the cloth backing, so that you get a smoother, more consistent finish. Seemingly small, these cartridge rolls conquer big challenges when space gets tight.",https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b40071827/,"{'Abrasive Material': 'Ceramic,Aluminum Oxide', 'Application': 'Grinding,Deburring,Finishing,Polishing', 'Arbor Hole Diameter (Imperial)': '0.125 in,0.25 in', 'Backing Material': 'Cloth', 'Backing Weight': 'X Weight', 'Bond Type': 'Resin,Resin Bond', 'Brands': '3M', 'Center Hole Diameter (Imperial)': '0.09375 in,0.125 in,0.1875 in,0.25 in,1.1875 in', 'Center Hole Diameter (Metric)': '2.381 mm,3.175 mm,4.763 mm,6.35 mm,30.1623 mm', 'Coat Type': 'Closed Coat', 'Equipment - Machines': 'Die Grinders', 'For Use On': 'Soft Metals', 'Grit': '36,50,60,80,P100,P120,P150', 'Industries': 'Metalworking,Marine', 'Maximum Speed': '9000 rpm,12000 rpm,16000 rpm,24000 rpm', 'Overall Diameter (Imperial)': '0.1875 in,0.25 in,0.3125 in,0.375 in,0.5 in,0.625 in,0.75 in,1 in,1.25 in,1.5 in', 'Overall Diameter (Metric)': '4.7625 mm,6.35 mm,7.9375 mm,9.525 mm,12.7 mm,15.875 mm,19.05 mm,25.4 mm,31.75 mm,38.1 mm', 'Overall Length (Imperial)': '0.75 in,1 in,1.5 in,2 in,2.25 in,2.5 in', 'Overall Length (Metric)': '19.05 mm,25.4 mm,38.1 mm,50.8 mm,57.15 mm,63.5 mm', 'Product Color': 'Orange', 'Product Form': 'Cartridge Roll', 'Roll Form': 'Straight,Full Tapered,End Tapered', 'Sub Applications': 'Blending Corners,Polishing Internal Diameters,Deburring Internal Diameters,Blending,Contour Finishing', 'Sub Industries': 'Metal Fabrication'}",https://cdmsweb.3m.com/ingredientcommunication/file/Media/0Jscfj8T2LA=,,https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/926868O/3m-metalworking-catalogue.pdf?&fn=3M-Metalworking-Catalog-High-Resolution.pdf,

It features light A-weight paper backing with sharp, durable aluminum oxide abrasive – a fast, aggressive cut, yet a uniform finish for feather-edging and primer sanding. Load-resistant coating and various available hole pattern provide good dust resistance. Discs come both with and without holes Sharp Abrasive for a Refined Finish With its open coat construction and aluminum oxide mineral abrasive, our 3M™ Hookit™ Gold Disc 216U provides a sharp cut (PDF, 4.14 Mb) — more aggressive than a comparable closed coat abrasive of the same grade — without dust accumulating on the disc. And its fine grades from P220 to P800 along with light A-weight paper backing make it ideal for feather-edging, as a final step before priming or for primer sanding. The Hookit™ Gold Disc 216U is available in 3-, 5- or 6-inch diameter sizes for substrates including clear coat, fiberglass, paint, primer and plastic. Resists Dust and Debris Open coat construction means the abrasive grains on our 3M™ Hookit™ Gold Disc 216U are placed with space between them to help evacuate sanding dust and other debris to avoid clogging the cutting edge of the grains. The load-resistant coating on the abrasive grains also allows the disc to continue cutting even when sanding paints and other materials that would otherwise clog the disc and hinder sanding ability. All of this adds up to increased productivity and reduced material consumption. The 6-hole pattern on select versions of 3M™ Hookit™ Gold Disc 216U facilitates dust evacuation, keeping it off of the disc and the workpiece for longer disc life and a more consistent finish. This design doesn't even require alignment of holes with the disc pad, making disc changes quick and simple. 7-hole pattern for dust evacuation Our Hookit™ Attachment System 3M offers a complete line of hook-and-loop style Hookit™ discs for work spaces where adhesive backed discs may become contaminated by dust, dirt, or flying debris.

The design achieves an ideal balance between the abrasive surface and dust extraction holes to maximize cut and optimize the life of the disc. Built for a Broad Range of Applications 3M Xtract™ Paper Disc 236U is excellent for blending and finishing on aluminum and carbon steel, as well as woodworking applications for heavy and medium stock removal and finishing on hardwoods, softwoods, and composites. These clean sanding discs also work well on primer, paint, sealers, topcoats, fiberglass, and plastics. Open Coat Helps Reduce Loading The strong, C-weight paper backing on3M Xtract™ Paper Disc 236U supports aggressive sanding and minimizes edge wear. An open coat means the abrasive grains have space between them so that dust escapes through the spaces rather than loading the cutting edge of the grains. The load resistant coating allows the disc to continue cutting even when sanding softwoods, paints, and other materials that would, otherwise, clog the disc and hinder sanding ability. Efficient Dust Extraction Sandpaper discs cut better and last longer when dust isn't loading the cutting surface of the abrasives. Reducing dust is easier than ever with 3M Xtract™ Discs, designed for optimal dust removal. For maximum dust extraction, use this disc with a 3M Xtract™ Hookit™ Back-up Pad and a random orbital sander with vacuum (both sold separately).

Abrasive belts come in many different widths and lengths and are used on a variety of different belt sanding tools for many different applications on both wood and metal. Ideal for Robotic Finishing With a wide range of conformability options and high consistency, long-lasting Scotch-Brite™ industrial abrasives are a great option for robotic metal finishing. Scotch-Brite™ Surface Conditioning Belts can generate a spec-required, aesthetic finish when used in both manual and robotic processing. Choose the Right Belt for You At 3M we offer a broad selection of belts to fit most any industrial belt sander. Wide belt sanders are used for sanding and finishing large wood panels. Medium-width belts fit onto edge or portable belt sanders for sanding or blending wood pieces such as cabinet doors, and narrow belts are used with file tools in metalworking to access small areas or inside corners. Blending and finishing stainless steel Hard-Working Minerals: Aluminum Oxide and Silicon Carbide We manufacture Scotch-Brite™ Surface Conditioning Belts with a choice of silicon carbide or aluminum oxide abrasive mineral. Silicon carbide is a synthetic mineral that is very sharp and commonly used for low-pressure applications such as paint prep and finishing. Aluminum oxide is a hard, blocky mineral that provides high cut-rate and long life. While silicon carbide breaks down faster than aluminum oxide, it produces a finer finish. An Alternative for Wheels and Discs Belt sanders are used for rapid grinding, sanding and finishing on a variety of surfaces. Depending on the material being worked, sanding wheels and discs may clog, quickly making them less efficient, while belt sanders continue to sand without clogging because small grooves in the abrasive belt open as they go around the arc of the drive wheel.

Known for its strength and resilience, the polyester film backing makes it tough so that it can withstand heavy-duty finishing. The rolls are also color coded by grade to help you reduce the risk of selecting the wrong grade. Waterproof Backing Polyester film backings are also water resistant, so the abrasive may be run with a wet lubricant, which helps wash away unwanted swarf and debris and keeps the abrasive running cool. When used in roll form for a process like superfinishing, our 675L roll enables slow abrasive feed rates and requires fewer steps, because of its durability, which in turn can reduce costs. Achieving the Desired Roughness Average Many microfinished products require a specific Ra, or roughness average. To obtain the desired Ra when applying thermal spray coatings, we recommend following a unique sequence of steps tailored to the substrate. It is important for operators to consider these factors — Ra and substrate — when selecting the grade of film for this belt. Overall, this micron-graded diamond abrasive delivers the desired finish without compromising the integrity of the substrate. Its strength and versatility make it a suitable abrasive for your finishing needs. <strong class=""MMM--txt_bold"" ""=""""> Superfinishing with 3M™ Diamond Microfinishing Film 675L Sequential Surface Finishes Obtained (Ra Micro Inch) Roll Material 74μ 45μ 30μ 20μ Tungsten Carbide Ra 12-16 8-12 5-8 2.5-5 Chrome Carbide Ra 15-20 10-14 6-10 4-6 Nickel Based Ra 20-55 14-19 6-10 4-6 Chrome Oxide Ra -55 -45 — — Operating Conditions Recommended Acceptable Range Workpiece Speed 300 sfpm 150-350 Traverse Rate 0.07 inch/rev 0.03-0.1 Abrasive Support 65 Shore A Roller — Abrasive Speed 0.5-1.0 inch/min — Pressure 20 lbs/inch width 10-40 Oscillation Alternating Moderate/None Coolant Water with 4-8% synthetic coolant",https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b40074769/,"{'Abrasive Material': 'Diamond', 'Application': 'Finishing', 'Backing Material': 'Polyester Film,Film', 'Backing Thickness (Imperial)': '5 mil', 'Bond Type': 'Resin', 'Brands': '3M', 'Core Size (Imperial)': '3 in', 'Core Size (Metric)': '76.2 mm', 'Equipment - Machines': 'Superfinishing Machines', 'Hole Configuration': 'Plain', 'Industries': 'Transportation & Heavy Equipment,Aerospace,General Industrial,Precision Grinding & Finishing', 'Micron Grade': '9 μm,20 μm,30 μm,45 μm,74 μm,125 μm', 'Overall Length (Imperial)': '25 ft,50 ft,150 ft', 'Overall Length (Metric)': '7.5 m,15.24 m,15.25 m,45.75 m', 'Overall Width (Imperial)': '4 in,8 in', 'Overall Width (Metric)': '101.6 mm,203.2 mm', 'Product Color': 'Beige,Green,Light Green,Gray,Orange,Teal', 'Product Form': 'Roll', 'Sub Applications': 'Superfinishing'}",https://cdmsweb.3m.com/ingredientcommunication/file/Media/RSJMujvXEaY=,,,https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/387568O/3m-abrasive-products-for-grinding-and-finishing-of-hard-to-grind-matls-leaflet.pdf?&fn=61-5002-8137-5.pdf

Its X-weight poly-cotton backing is flexible. This belt is optimized for low and medium pressure applications on stainless steel, mild steels, and aluminum. Cubitron™ II abrasives divert heat to the swarf, keeping both the work piece and the belt cooler Fast and Flexible A closed coat and a grinding aid make our 3M™ Cubitron II Abrasive Belt 947A an outstanding option for low to medium pressure applications on heat sensitive metals. The nature of the abrasive structure diverts heat to the swarf, keeping both belt and workpiece cooler. It is now available in grades 40+ (make to order), 60+, 80+ and now 120+ adding an improved solution for finer finishing applications. Cutting Edge Performance for Low and Medium Pressure Sanding A semi flexible Cubitron II belt the 3M™ 947A sports an X-weight poly-cotton backing. Among backing weights, an X-weight cloth is flexible and provides tensile strength as well. A great number of small belt sizes which are nimble and maneuverable so operators can get in, over and around intricate parts. These belts are good options for low-and-medium-pressure offhand operations for use on the following equipment: Backstands File Belt Sanders Inline Sanders Stroke Sanders How 3M Precision-Shaped Grain Works 3M Precision-Shaped Grain is designed to continuously fracture to form sharp points and edges that easily ""slice"" through metal. It cuts faster, lasts longer and stays cooler. Conventional ceramic abrasive grain tends to ""plow"" through the metal, causing heat to build up in the workpiece and the abrasive — resulting in a slower cut, shorter belt life and undesirable effects, such as burnishing. 3M Science. The Beginning of Cubitron II. In 2009, 3M scientists had long believed abrasives would work better if each grain of the ceramic abrasive material was exactly the same size and shape. It would act more like a knife shaving off material and less like a plow bouncing along the surface, creating heat damage. The breakthrough came when they realized they could use microreplication technology 3M was already using to create reflective material for signs, and other purposes. Within a short time, they had created 3M's Precision Shaped Grain — identical triangular-shaped abrasive grains electrostatically oriented and distributed uniformly on an abrasive backing. The end result is faster, cooler cutting action, improved productivity, less operator fatigue and longer belt life.

Cubitron™ abrasives feature our Precision-Shaped Grain (PSG) technology, which allows our engineers to control the geometry of the abrasive grain for a truly fast, efficient cut. Instead of simply crushing the abrasive into particles, 3M uses microreplication to uniformly size ceramic grains and precisely shape them into triangular structures — essentially, sharp peaks that slice, not plow, through paint and metal. These grains are electrostatically oriented on the abrasive surface for the most efficient cut and even wear. What's more, PSG fractures during use to maintain sharp abrasive edges. The result: Cubitron™ II cuts 30% faster and lasts 2x longer than conventional ceramic abrasives. Wears evenly and provides super-long life and consistency at any grinding pressure Time-Saving Quick Change Attachment Our 3M™Fibre Roloc™ Disc Quick Change Attachment System is convenient and saves time.

Constructed with aluminum oxide abrasive, these utility rolls come in a range of grades for common applications such as deburring, blending and repairing metal finishes, rust or other contaminant removal, and surface preparation for paints and coatings. Metal Working, Pipe Fitting, Plumbing, and Machine Shop applications The desired length of the strip can be torn from the roll for a specific application. Most grades have a light, J-weight cloth backing that provides the flexibility needed to conform to circular edges, angles, or other contours. Rolls in grades P50 or P60 have a slightly stiffer X-weight backing suitable for more coarse sanding applications. Cloth remains durable even when bent or rolled, without tearing or shelling, but strips can be torn by hand when a smaller piece is needed, without compromising the sanding surface. Aluminum oxide is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its fast cut-rate and long life. This mineral makes a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges, whereas traditional natural abrasives dull more quickly.

Its unique web construction and formulation allows the disc to resist loading while giving you an aggressive cut and long product life – on both edges and flat surfaces. Excellence in Surface Conditioning With this versatile capability, our Scotch-Brite™ Roloc™ SL Surface Conditioning Discs can reduce or eliminate subsequent conditioning steps for weld clean up, grindline refinement, metal blending, and even light deburring. Available in four grades: Medium, Coarse, Heavy Duty and Super Duty, the open-web, non woven SL disc runs cool, resists loading, and maintains cut-rate consistency throughout the life of the disc. These same attributes allow you to use less pressure, reducing fatigue and maximizing disc life. Tough and Sharp We use aluminum oxide abrasive mineral in the Scotch-Brite™ Roloc™ SL Surface Conditioning Disc. Aluminum oxide is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its cut-rate and long life. This mineral is a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges in use, whereas traditional abrasives, such as garnet, quickly wear down with use. Due to its high cut-rate, hardness, strength, and low heat retention, aluminum oxide is widely used in grinding applications in addition to sanding and finishing use. Aluminum oxide is suitable on a wide variety of substrates in both woodworking and metalworking, including ferrous alloys. The Benefits of RolocTM Attachment 3M™ Roloc™ TR quick change discs are smaller discs that quickly attach onto a Roloc™ disc pad (sold separately) so that you can conveniently and quickly change discs as needed. Our Roloc TR and TSM systems provide a secure attachment even for heavy-duty applications, and the variety of our other 3M Roloc discs allows swapping from one application to the next in seconds. Each disc is also color-coded to identify its grade, making it easy to grab the grade required for different applications. The Scotch-Brite™ Advantage We developed Scotch-Brite™ surface conditioning products with abrasives incorporated into non-woven nylon or synthetic fibers. Combining abrasives with the fibers creates an abrasive system that delivers consistent results for the life of the product. The open-web material runs cool, reducing the risk of part discoloration and warping. The fibers are load resistant and keep the abrasive minerals cutting at high performance by limiting clogging of the fibers, which also extends the life of the disc.",https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b40064718/,"{'Abrasive Material': 'Aluminum Oxide', 'Application': 'Blending,Refining,Deburring,Finishing,Radiusing,Grinding', 'Attachment Type': 'TR,TS,TSM', 'Brands': 'Scotch-Brite', 'Equipment - Machines': 'Disc Sanders,Right Angle Grinders', 'Grade': 'Coarse,Medium,Super Duty Coarse,Heavy Duty Coarse', 'Industries': 'Manufacturing,Metal Fabrication,Heavy Industrial,Machinery Manufacturing,Transportation & Heavy Equipment,General Industrial,Food & Beverage,Metalworking,Paint Preparation', 'Maximum Speed': '12000 rpm,18000 rpm,25000 rpm', 'Overall Diameter (Imperial)': '2 in,3 in,4 in', 'Overall Diameter (Metric)': '50.8 mm,76.2 mm,101.6 mm', 'Product Color': 'Light Brown,Maroon,Black,Dark Brown', 'Sub Applications': 'Blending,Parting Line Removal,Prepping Metal Prior to Paint,Refining Scratches,Deburring Edges,Radiusing,Finishing,Light Grinding', 'Substrate': 'Titanium,Aluminum,Mild Steel,Nickel Alloy,Stainless Steel,All Metal'}",https://cdmsweb.3m.com/ingredientcommunication/file/Media/k28QRB+w1ZA=,,"https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/926868O/3m-metalworking-catalogue.pdf?&fn=3M-Metalworking-Catalog-High-Resolution.pdf,https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/2010476O/scotch-brite-nonwoven-abrasives-product-guide-high-resolution.pdf?&fn=Scotch-Brite-Nonwoven-Abrasives-Product-Guide-HR-61-5005-0007-1.pdf",

An extension of 3M’s Precision Surface Conditioning Disc family, these discs are ideal for high-pressure applications, such as grinding, deburring, edge breaking, blending, and refining, lasting longer than competitive premium nonwoven abrasives while offering edge durability and shape retention during edge wear; grade XXCRS (60+) lasts 2X longer on mild steel and finishes 3X more mild steel parts compared to competitive premium nonwoven abrasives (based on 3M Internal Testing). The key to this disc’s enhanced performance is 3M Precision-Shaped Grain technology, a proprietary molecular bonding technology designed with sharp, angular structures that continuously fracture to form sharp points. Scotch-Brite™ Precision Heavy Duty Surface Conditioning Discs are available in MED (150+), CRS (120+), XCRS (80+), and XXCRS (60+). The cutting performance of 3M Precision-Shaped Grain is only half of the equation for what makes Scotch-Brite™ Precision Heavy Duty Surface Conditioning Discs so effective. The other element to their construction is tried-and-true Scotch-Brite™ Nonwoven Web Technology, which is made from nylon and abrasive mineral and strengthened with resin. The fibers and sharp abrasive particles are bound together to form an open, three-dimensional structure that allows fresh abrasive to be exposed as the disc wears, resulting in longer life and more consistent performance. This combination of cutting power and anti-load technology help extend the life of the abrasive product while improving finish consistency.

The roll offers quick access to a disc and eliminates disc liners. The disc features a strong, C-weight paper backing that resists wear during aggressive sanding. Versatile Abrasives Sands a Range of Surfaces The open-coat construction and load-resistant coating help prevent clogging to maximize cut and the useful life of the disc. 3M™ Stikit™ Paper Disc Roll 236U can be used for sanding and finishing on many different surfaces, such as paint, primer, softwood, metal, plastic, hard and soft composites, and fiberglass. Stikit™ Discs: Ready-to-Use Our 3M™ Stikit™ discs are designed to handle a wide range of sanding and finishing needs. These high-quality, coated abrasive products come ready to use with a pressure sensitive adhesive coating on the backside so they conveniently press on to the backup pad, and remove cleanly, leaving an uncontaminated surface for the next disc. The Stikit™ disc should be used in conjunction with our 3M™ Stikit™ backup pad (also called a disc pad and sold separately) that is attached to a disc sander, random orbital sander, or stationary disc sander. Benefits of Aluminum Oxide Aluminum oxide is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its fast cut-rate and long life. This mineral makes a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges, whereas traditional natural abrasives dull more quickly. Due to its fast cut-rate, hardness, and strength, it is widely used in grinding applications in addition to sanding and finishing applications. Aluminum oxide is suitable for a wide variety of materials in both woodworking and metalworking, including ferrous alloys. Load-Resistant for Prolonged Sharp Cut and Service Life 3M™ Stikit™ Paper Discs feature a load-resistant coating that allows the disc to continue cutting even when sanding softwoods, paints, and other materials that would, otherwise, clog the surface of the disc and hinder sanding ability. An open coat means the abrasive grains are spaced slightly apart so that dust can escape rather than loading the cutting edge of the grains, thereby optimizing cut-rate and disc life.

Very fine grade aluminum oxide abrasives cut fast and fine, leaving a smooth, finished surface. Suitable for use on a wide variety of materials and for many different tasks. May be used with hand block to access hard-to-reach areas Suitable for a wide variety of subsrates Offers Precise Hand Control The performance of Scotch-Brite™ General Purpose Hand Pad 7447 is comparable to steel wool grade 1. However, unlike steel wool, our Scotch-Brite™ pads won't shred during use, rust after use, or create fine metal splinters. The non-woven, open-web material resists loading and can be used dry, with water or solvents, and rinsed clean for reuse. This multipurpose 6 x 9"" pad can be used by hand for precise control, with a hand pad block for uniform finishing, or on an in-line sander to cover large areas. Hand held abrasive bends and curves to round out your finish May Be Used on a Variety of Substrates This maroon hand pad uses aluminum oxide abrasive. Aluminum oxide is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its cut-rate and long life. This mineral is a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges in use, whereas traditional abrasives, such as garnet, quickly wear down with use. Due to its high cut-rate, hardness, strength, and low heat retention, aluminum oxide mineral is widely used in grinding applications in addition to sanding and finishing use. Aluminum oxide is suitable on a wide variety of substrates in both woodworking and metalworking, including ferrous alloys. Many Benefits of Open-Web Abrasives Our Scotch-Brite&trade industrial abrasive products are a unique surface conditioning product with abrasives incorporated into non-woven nylon or other synthetic fibers.

It aggressively removes paint and rust from seams, door jambs, drip moldings, pinchwelds and other difficult-to-reach areas. The Many Benefits of Open Web Abrasives Nonwoven technology makes our Scotch-Brite™ industrial abrasives unique. A combination of fiber strands, resin, and abrasive mineral forms a thick, open web. The spring-like nature of the fibers responds to contours and effectively removes unwanted burrs, soils, and contaminants while maintaining the geometry of the workpiece, which in turn reduces rework and boosts productivity. Gaps in the web allow swarf to escape, so debris does not clog the mineral. Fibers in the web continually break down with use to reveal fresh mineral for exceptional consistency, superior cut performance, and extremely long service life.

This cut-off wheel surpasses 3M™ High Performance wheels in both cut and life to deliver significant gains in productivity. Experience the power of 3M Precision Shaped Grain to provide a cool, extra-sharp, quick cut long after other wheels are consumed. Tips for Optimal Use Unlike coated abrasive discs, which shape or sand objects using the disc surface, cut-off wheels provide perpendicular cuts, using the outer edge of the wheel. Abrasive cut-off wheels are typically used for cutting through metal, for example autobody or marine sheet metal, stainless steel tubing, exhaust pipes, clamps, and rusted fasteners. Cut-off wheels are attached to a cut-off wheel tool (sold separately) and must always be used with a wheel guard for safety. 3M™ Science and the Power of Precision Shaped Grain 3M™ Cubitron™ II products have raised the bar for high-performing abrasives. 3M Precision Shaped Grain (PSG) outcuts and outlasts conventional ceramic industrial abrasives and requires less grinding force to achieve superior performance. The result is that operators can grind faster and complete more parts per disc with less muscle-work and fatigue. Conventional Shaped Grain 3M Precision-Shaped Grain To create PSG, our engineers started with 3M™ Ceramic Abrasive Grain and used proprietary technology to form the grains into triangular structures and electrostatically orient them on the backing to form sharp peaks that maximize cutting potential. These peaks slice cleanly through metal like a knife through butter, rather than gouging or plowing as traditional abrasives do, and continuously self-sharpen as the points break off. This generates a super-fast cut and lessens heat build-up due to friction, reducing heat-related stress cracks and discoloration. PSG also wears evenly, and because the abrasive itself stays cooler and sharper, 3M™ Cubitron™ II products last significantly longer than their conventional ceramic counterparts, ensuring extended high performance in production applications.",https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b49000206/,"{'Abrasive Material': 'Precision Shaped Ceramic', 'Application': 'Cutting,Grinding', 'Attachment Type': 'Center Hole', 'Bond Type': 'Resin', 'Brands': '3M', 'Center Hole Diameter (Imperial)': '0.25 in,0.375 in,0.875 in', 'Center Hole Diameter (Metric)': '6.35 mm,9.53 mm,22.23 mm', 'Equipment - Machines': 'Cut-off Wheel,Right Angle Grinders', 'Grit': '36+,60+', 'Industries': 'Metalworking', 'Maximum Speed': '80 mps,100 mps', 'Net Weight (Imperial)': '0.03 lb,0.04 lb,0.06 lb,0.1 lb,0.27 lb', 'Net Weight (Metric)': '11.79 g,18.14 g,25.86 g,45.36 g,121.11 g', 'Overall Diameter (Imperial)': '3 in,4 in,4.5 in,5 in,7 in', 'Overall Diameter (Metric)': '75 mm,100 mm,115 mm,125 mm,180 mm', 'Overall Thickness (Imperial)': '0.035 in,0.04 in,0.063 in,0.09 in', 'Overall Thickness (Metric)': '0.889 mm,1 mm,1.6 mm,2 mm', 'Product Color': 'Black', 'Product Form': 'Cut-off Wheel', 'Sub Applications': 'Flash Removal,Gate Removal,Right Angle Grinding,Rod Cutting,Pipe Cutting', 'Sub Industries': 'Medical Instruments,Metal Implants,Turbine Engines,Builders Hardware,Metal Fabrication,Plumbing Fixtures', 'Wheel Type': 'T1,T27'}",,,https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/926868O/3m-metalworking-catalogue.pdf?&fn=3M-Metalworking-Catalog-High-Resolution.pdf,"https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1273214O/3m-abrasives-for-right-angle-tools-field-guide-brochure.pdf?&fn=3M-Abrasives-Right-Angle-Field-Guide.pdf,https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1017953O/3m-abrasives-for-right-angle-system-the-right-choice-brochure.pdf?&fn=Right-Angle-Brochure-61-5002-8389-2-LR.pdf"

Durable, nonwoven fiber construction conforms well on irregular or contoured surfaces without undercutting or damaging the base material. Attach and remove easily to 3M™ Hook-and-Loop Backup Pads The open-web material runs cool and resists loading to enable prolonged operation while evenly distributed aluminum oxide abrasives produce a high cut-rate for consistent finishing. Our Scotch-Brite™ Surface Conditioning Disc uses aluminum oxide abrasive. Aluminum oxide is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its cut-rate and long life. This mineral is a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges in use, whereas traditional abrasives, such as garnet, quickly wear down with use. Due to its high cut-rate, hardness, strength, and low heat retention, aluminum oxide mineral is widely used in grinding applications in addition to sanding and finishing use. Aluminum oxide is suitable on a wide variety of substrates in both woodworking and metalworking, including ferrous alloys. Use with right angle and random orbital tools Our Scotch-Brite™ industrial abrasives are unique surface conditioning products with abrasives incorporated into non-woven nylon or synthetic fibers. Combining abrasives with the fibers creates an abrasive system that delivers consistent results for the life of the product.

This grinding wheel works well on almost all materials and is specially formulated for use on stainless steel, mild steel, and aerospace alloys. Cuts Fast and Cool We made our 3M™ Cubitron™ II Depressed Center Grinding Wheel to perform at a level that surpasses competitive wheels in both cut and life to deliver significant gains in productivity. Experience the power of 3M Precision-Shaped Grain to provide a cool, extra-sharp, quick cut long after other wheels are consumed. Ideal for Robotic Weld Grinding In medium and high-pressure applications like robotic weld grinding, it's important to choose a high-performance abrasive that cuts fast and lasts long. The self-fracturing mineral in 3M™ Cubitron™ II Depressed Center Grinding Wheel will keep your robot grinding welds long after other abrasives call it quits, reducing downtime and maximizing efficiency. As the chart shows, after ten minutes of grinding, Cubitron II grinding wheels tripled the output of its competitors. Grinding Wheel: Tips for Optimum Use A grinding wheel is a rigid resin-bonded wheel that is approximately 1/4"" thick and is useful for removing welds from internal angles. Fiber discs, on the other hand, typically work best for grinding welds on flat surfaces. A grinding wheel must be run on a right angle grinder with a wheel guard that is designed specifically for the size of wheel used. Type 27 wheels have a depressed center to allow grinding at any angle without damaging the surrounding surface with the attachment. The grinding wheel must have a maximum operating speed greater than or equal to the maximum speed of the grinder used. 3M Precision-Shaped Grain Maximizes Cutting Potential 3M™ Cubitron™ II products have raised the bar for high-performing abrasives. Our team of 3M engineers started with 3M™ ceramic abrasive grain and used proprietary precision-shaped grain technology to maximize cutting potential. Precision-shaped grain continually fractures into super-sharp points and edges that slice cleanly through metal like a knife, rather than plowing as traditional abrasives do, ensuring extended high performance in heavy-duty production applications. The grains wear evenly and provide extra-long life and consistency with less grinding pressure. We are proud to say that 3M™ Cubitron™ II abrasives outcut and outlast competitive ceramic abrasives, maximizing productivity and minimizing operator fatigue. 3M precision-shaped grain in Cubitron II grinding wheels continuously fracture to form sharp points and edges – slicing cleaner and faster, staying cooler and lasting many times longer Conventional ceramic abrasive grain is irregular in shape.

As the outermost abrasive layer wears down, the cloth backing frays to expose fresh abrasive layers for continued cutting action. Access Hard-to-Reach Spaces Our 3M™ Cartridge Roll 341D has a closed coat of aluminum oxide abrasive secured with a heat-resistant resin bond. Cartridge rolls fit onto a cartridge roll mandrel (sold separately) and is ideal for accessing small, hard to reach spaces. Cartridge Roll 341D is used in metalworking applications. Ideal for fast cutting on irregular contours and other hard-to-reach areas Tough, Durable Abrasive Aluminum oxide is a popular choice among industrial professionals because of its fast cut-rate and long life. This mineral makes a tough, durable abrasive that self-fractures to expose fresh cutting edges, whereas traditional natural abrasives dull more quickly. Due to its fast cut-rate, hardness, and strength, it is widely used in grinding applications in addition to sanding and finishing applications. Aluminum oxide is suitable for a wide variety of materials in both woodworking and metalworking, including ferrous alloys. Cartridge rolls fit onto a compatible mandrel Sturdy Binding Agent Heat-resistant resin is a sturdy binding agent that adheres the abrasive to the backing and maintains the stability of the bond even in conditions of high heat or pressure. Compatible with Mandrels Cartridge rolls fit onto a compatible mandrel (sold separately) that attaches to a rotary tool such as a die grinder or drill. Together, the mandrel and cartridge roll enable the user to grind or finish hard-to-reach areas of a workpiece. To ensure correct fit, the center hole diameter of the cartridge roll must be equal the diameter of the mandrel pilot inserted into the cartridge roll.",https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/p/d/b40071826/,"{'Abrasive Material': 'Aluminum Oxide', 'Application': 'Grinding,Polishing,Deburring,Finishing', 'Arbor Hole Diameter (Imperial)': '0.125 in,0.25 in', 'Attachment Type': 'Mandrel', 'Backing Material': 'Cloth', 'Backing Weight': 'X Weight', 'Bond Type': 'Resin,Resin Bond', 'Brands': '3M', 'Center Hole Diameter (Imperial)': '0.09375 in,0.125 in,0.1875 in,0.25 in', 'Center Hole Diameter (Metric)': '2.381 mm,3.175 mm,4.763 mm,6.35 mm', 'Coat Type': 'Closed Coat', 'Equipment - Machines': 'Die Grinders', 'For Use On': 'Aluminum,Stainless Steel,Carbon Steel,Soft Metals', 'Grit': '36,40,50,60,80,P100,P120,P150,P180,P240,P320,P400', 'Industries': 'Metalworking,Marine', 'Maximum Speed': '9000 rpm,12000 rpm,16000 rpm,24000 rpm', 'Overall Diameter (Imperial)': '0.125 in,0.1875 in,0.25 in,0.3125 in,0.375 in,0.5 in,0.625 in,0.75 in,1 in,1.25 in,1.5 in', 'Overall Diameter (Metric)': '3.175 mm,4.7625 mm,6.35 mm,7.9375 mm,9.525 mm,12.7 mm,15.875 mm,19.05 mm,25.4 mm,31.75 mm,38.1 mm', 'Overall Length (Imperial)': '0.75 in,1 in,1.5 in,1.75 in,2 in,2.5 in,3 in', 'Overall Length (Metric)': '19.05 mm,25.4 mm,38.1 mm,44.45 mm,50.8 mm,63.5 mm,76.2 mm', 'Product Color': 'Brown', 'Product Form': 'Cartridge Roll', 'Roll Form': 'Straight,Full Tapered,End Tapered', 'Sub Applications': 'Deburring Internal Diameters,Blending Corners,Polishing Internal Diameters,Blending,Contour Finishing', 'Sub Industries': 'Metal Fabrication'}",https://cdmsweb.3m.com/ingredientcommunication/file/Media/JV/ZG3E/C0g=,,https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/926868O/3m-metalworking-catalogue.pdf?&fn=3M-Metalworking-Catalog-High-Resolution.pdf,https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1037677O/3m-tm-abrasive-belts-for-metalworking-pamphlet-pdf-file.pdf?&fn=2015.pdf

The triangular shaped ceramic mineral is designed to slice through the substrate, rather than gouging or “plowing” like conventional abrasives, resulting in a disc that cuts up to 2x faster than conventional abrasives. The J-weight cloth backing delivers outstanding tear resistance, durability and a consistent, uniform finish on a variety of substrates. Exceptionally Hard and Strong Abrasive Grain Fast, efficient stock removal makes 3M™ Cubitron™ II Hookit™ Cloth Disc 900DZ one of best 3M discs for metal fabrication, woodworking, paint prep and composite applications. 3M Precision-Shaped Grain exceeds both aluminum oxide and silicon carbide mineral in cut-rate and durability. Its open coat construction resists accumulation of sawdust and other sanding debris. This allows the cutting edge of the grain to continue cutting efficiently, self-fracturing to expose fresh cutting edges. Neutralize Swarf, Keep Cutting Fast An anti-static treatment neutralizes the electrical charge generated by sanding, especially on wood. Static charged swarf tends to cling to the surface of the disc, the workpiece and the machinery when sanding. Coarse or fine or powdery, dust degrades performances and productivity. In concert with this disc's open coat abrasive, loading issues are minimized, keeping 3M™ Cubitron™ II Hookit™ Cloth Disc 900DZ cutting fast. Fast, Easy Disc Changes Simple, swift and secure, the 3M™ Hookit™ attachment system just works. The soft side of a 3M™ Hookit™ disc is covered with loops while its rougher mate has J-shaped hooks. When pressed together the two cling, secure even in rugged applications.

These versatile wheels serve as both a depressed center grinding wheel and a cut-off wheel, allowing you to seamlessly switch from cutting applications like back gouging to grinding a bevel without taking the time to switch out your wheel. Wheel is thin enough for effective fillet weld grinding Value and Versatility Versatile 3M™ Cut & Grind Wheels are designed for use as both a depressed center grinding wheel and a cut-off wheel to help you finish your jobs on time and on budget. In multi-step metalworking processes, these wheels save you the time and hassle of swapping out the abrasive on your grinder. Seamlessly transition/switch from cutting applications like back gouging to grinding a bevel without wasting time switching from a cut-off wheel to a grinding wheel. Plus, these powerful wheels with 3M Precision-Shaped Grain are competitively priced for incredible value. 3M Precision-Shaped Grain makes quick work of metal cutting tasks Powered by 3M Precision-Shaped Grain These cut & grind wheels feature a blend of 3M Precision-Shaped Grain. This innovative ceramic grain continually fractures into super-sharp points and edges that slice cleanly through metal, rather than gouging or plowing as traditional abrasives do. This also helps it to last significantly longer than conventional ceramic grain abrasives while maintaining a high cut-rate over the life of the wheel. Advanced Series Abrasives The 3M™ Cut & Grind Wheel is part of a new class of 3M abrasives designed to deliver an unbeatable combination of performance and value. Powered by the legendary speed and long life of 3M Precision-Shaped Grain, these Advanced Series Abrasives are ideal for a wide range of metal cutting and grinding applications — offering a longer life and faster cut than aluminum oxide, alumina zirconia and other conventional ceramic abrasives.
