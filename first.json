  "description": "Add rich, creamy flavor to your favorite dishes with Campbell's Condensed Cream of Potato Soup. This vegetarian soup is crafted with potatoes and farm-fresh cream to provide a deliciously smooth foundation to any recipe. Use it as the hero ingredient in classic dishes like Easy Chicken and Biscuits, or substitute it for roux or bechamel as a sauce starter. Campbell‚Äôs convenient canned soup is a year-round pantry staple and a must-have for creating something quick and easy. It's also delicious on its own, topped with fresh herbs or a drizzle of olive oil, or enjoyed with a sandwich or salad. Simply mix the condensed soup with 1 can of milk and microwave on high for 3 to 3.5 minutes in a covered microwave-safe bowl, or heat in a pot on the stove, stirring occasionally. Each 10.5 oz recyclable can contains about 2.5 servings of microwave soup and features a non-BPA lining. From Cream of Potato to Chicken Noodle and everything in between, Campbell's makes delicious soups in flavors your family knows and loves, with quality, farm-grown ingredients in every can. M'm! M'm! Good! This product is packaged in a metal can, and is shelf-stable.",

      "reviewBody": "Campbell's Condensed Cream of Potato Soup is a versatile pantry staple that delivers a rich, creamy flavor perfect for enhancing recipes or enjoying on its own. The smooth texture and savory taste work wonderfully in classic comfort dishes like casseroles or as a base for homemade sauces.\n\nI love that it's vegetarian and made with farm-fresh cream and potatoes. While it's convenient and easy to prepare, it's slightly on the salty side when consumed alone, which is why I docked one star. That said, it's still an excellent choice for quick, hearty meals.",

I cannot  believe the picker employee thought this was ok to distribute in my delivery order! The usual response I receive is to return the item by 30 days.  I am unable to return this to the store since I am a handicapped person who doesn't drive anymore. In the garbage it went! This is happening too frequently‚Ä¶damaged food items, out of date items past expiration dates, or items that are missing from orders that were supposed to be in the shipment. How can I return something I never received! The computer generated AI is not helpful and a waste of time! It is very frustrating and very expensive.",
