Bosch Fine Wire Double Iridium Spark Plug  - 8513,Spark Plug; Iridium; Copper; Bosch EVO spark plugs are engineered to ensure reliable ignition throughout its long service life-even under extreme conditions in modern engines. Thanks to its improved insulator design and high dielectric strength (greater than 45 kV) the new EVO spark plugs can withstand irregular combustion-known as mega knocking-that can occur in modern technologically advanced engines. Bosch EVO spark plugs are developed and produced with the same high quality as original equipment spark plugs. Today\'s turbocharged gasoline direct injection engines place high demands on spark plugs - the new Bosch EVO meets these needs. Thermomechanical strength: Improved insulator design features provide greater resistance to irregular burns and mega-knocking Mechanical strength: Improved design features on the insulator and housing increase the head bending strength reducing risk of damage during installation and optimizing gas seal tightness in the cylinder head Electrical strength: Improved design features on the insulator increase the dielectric strength (>45kV) Long service life: The iridium alloy in the firing pin of the center electrode and platinum-iridium alloy on the ground electrode reduces the wear on the electrodes and increases the service life of the spark plug Corrosion defense: Improved corrosion protection through the use of a process developed by Bosch for nickel coating of the spark plug housing Important: Always torque to the proper specification using a torque wrench,"The Mobility Aftermarket division (MA) provides the aftermarket and repair shops worldwide with modern diagnostic and repair shop equipment and a wide range of spare parts - from new and exchange parts to repair solutions - for passenger cars and commercial vehicles.

Bosch EVO Spark Plug  - 8515,Spark Plug; Iridium; Copper; Bosch EVO spark plugs are engineered to ensure reliable ignition throughout its long service life-even under extreme conditions in modern engines. Thanks to its improved insulator design and high dielectric strength (greater than 45 kV) the new EVO spark plugs can withstand irregular combustion-known as mega knocking-that can occur in modern technologically advanced engines. Bosch EVO spark plugs are developed and produced with the same high quality as original equipment spark plugs. Today\'s turbocharged gasoline direct injection engines place high demands on spark plugs - the new Bosch EVO meets these needs. Thermomechanical strength: Improved insulator design features provide greater resistance to irregular burns and mega-knocking Mechanical strength: Improved design features on the insulator and housing increase the head bending strength reducing risk of damage during installation and optimizing gas seal tightness in the cylinder head Electrical strength: Improved design features on the insulator increase the dielectric strength (>45kV) Long service life: The iridium alloy in the firing pin of the center electrode and platinum-iridium alloy on the ground electrode reduces the wear on the electrodes and increases the service life of the spark plug Corrosion defense: Improved corrosion protection through the use of a process developed by Bosch for nickel coating of the spark plug housing Important: Always torque to the proper specification using a torque wrench,"The Mobility Aftermarket division (MA) provides the aftermarket and repair shops worldwide with modern diagnostic and repair shop equipment and a wide range of spare parts - from new and exchange parts to repair solutions - for passenger cars and commercial vehicles.
